This was solved back then by fetching the OpenAPI\nv2 in kubectl and using it to verify that fields were correct and\npresent before applying. Unfortunately, at that time, Custom Resource\nDefinitions didn’t exist, and the code was written under that\nassumption. When CRDs were later introduced, the lack of flexibility\nin the validation code forced some hard decisions in the way CRDs\nexposed their schema, leaving us in a cycle of bad validation causing\nbad OpenAPI and vice-versa. With the new OpenAPI v3 and Server Field\nValidation being GA in 1.27, we’ve now solved both of these problems.</p>\n<p>Server Side Field Validation offers resource validation on create,\nupdate and patch requests to the apiserver and was added to Kubernetes\nin v1.25, beta in v1.26 and is now GA in v1.27. It provides all the\nfunctionality of kubectl validate on the server side.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://swagger.io/specification/\">OpenAPI</a> is a standard, language\nagnostic interface for discovering the set of operations and types\nthat a Kubernetes cluster supports. OpenAPI V3 is the latest standard\nof the OpenAPI and is an improvement upon <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/12/kubernetes-supports-openapi/\">OpenAPI\nV2</a>\nwhich has been supported since Kubernetes 1.5. OpenAPI V3 support was\nadded in Kubernetes in v1.23, moved to beta in v1.24 and is now GA in\nv1.27.</p>\n<h2 id=\"openapi-v3\">OpenAPI V3</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-does-openapi-v3-offer-over-v2\">What does OpenAPI V3 offer over V2</h3>\n<h4 id=\"built-in-types\">Built-in types</h4>\n<p>Kubernetes offers certain annotations on fields that are not\nrepresentable in OpenAPI V2, or sometimes not represented in the\nOpenAPI v2 that Kubernetes generate. Most notably, the &quot;default&quot; field\nis published in OpenAPI V3 while omitted in OpenAPI V2. A single type\nthat can represent multiple types is also expressed correctly in\nOpenAPI V3 with the oneOf field. This includes proper representations\nfor IntOrString and Quantity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"custom-resource-definitions\">Custom Resource Definitions</h4>\n<p>In Kubernetes, Custom Resource Definitions use a structural OpenAPI V3\nschema that cannot be represented as OpenAPI V2 without a loss of\ncertain fields. Some of these include nullable, default, anyOf, oneOf,\nnot, etc. OpenAPI V3 is a completely lossless representation of the\nCustomResourceDefinition structural schema.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h3>\n<p>The OpenAPI V3 root discovery can be found at the <code>/openapi/v3</code>\nendpoint of a Kubernetes API server. OpenAPI V3 documents are grouped\nby group-version to reduce the size of the data transported, the\nseparate documents can be accessed at\n<code>/openapi/v3/apis/&lt;group&gt;/&lt;version&gt;</code> and <code>/openapi/v3/api/v1</code>\nrepresenting the legacy group version. Please refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/\">Kubernetes\nAPI Documentation</a> for more\ninformation around this endpoint.</p>\n<p>Various consumers of the OpenAPI have already been updated to consume\nv3, including the entirety of kubectl, and server side apply. An\nOpenAPI V3 Golang client is available in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/release-1.27/openapi3/root.go\">client-go</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"server-side-field-validation\">Server Side Field Validation</h2>\n<p>The query parameter <code>fieldValidation</code> may be used to indicate the\nlevel of field validation the server should perform. If the parameter\nis not passed, server side field validation is in <code>Warn</code> mode by\ndefault.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strict: Strict field validation, errors on validation failure</li>\n<li>Warn: Field validation is performed, but errors are exposed as\nwarnings rather than failing the request</li>\n<li>Ignore: No server side field validation is performed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>kubectl will skip client side validation and will automatically use\nserver side field validation in <code>Strict</code> mode. Controllers by default\nuse server side field validation in <code>Warn</code> mode.</p>\n<p>With client side validation, we had to be extra lenient because some\nfields were missing from OpenAPI V2 and we didn’t want to reject\npossibly valid objects. This is all fixed in server side validation.\nAdditional documentation may be found\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#field-validation\">here</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>With Server Side Field Validation and OpenAPI V3 released as GA, we\nintroduce more accurate representations of Kubernetes resources. It is\nrecommended to use server side field validation over client side, but\nwith OpenAPI V3, clients are free to implement their own validation if\nnecessary (to “shift things left”) and we guarantee a full lossless\nschema published by OpenAPI.</p>\n<p>Some existing efforts will further improve the information available\nthrough OpenAPI including <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/\">CEL validation and\nadmission</a>, along with OpenAPI\nannotations on built-in types.</p>\n<p>Many other tools can be built for authoring and transforming resources\nusing the type information found in the OpenAPI v3.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-involved\">How to get involved?</h2>\n<p>These two features are driven by the SIG API Machinery community,\navailable on the slack channel #sig-api-machinery, through the\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-api-machinery\">mailing\nlist</a> and we\nmeet every other Wednesday at 11:00 AM PT on Zoom.</p>\n<p>We offer a huge thanks to all the contributors who helped design,\nimplement, and review these two features.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alexander Zielenski</li>\n<li>Antoine Pelisse</li>\n<li>Daniel Smith</li>\n<li>David Eads</li>\n<li>Jeffrey Ying</li>\n<li>Jordan Liggitt</li>\n<li>Kevin Delgado</li>\n<li>Sean Sullivan</li>\n</ul>","PublishedAt":"2023-04-24 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/24/openapi-v3-field-validation-ga/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":3476,"Title":"Building a cybersecurity plan for the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP)","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-04-24 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/cybersecurity-plan-state-local-cybersecurity-grant-program","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3477,"Title":"Monitor your Linux web apps on Azure App Service with Datadog","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/monitor-azure-app-service-linux/azure-linux-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Azure App Service is a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution for deploying web applications, event-driven functions, RESTful APIs, and more.

They usually have to SSH or RDP into the node to view the\nlogs of the service to debug the issue. The <em>Node log query</em> feature helps with\nthis scenario by allowing the cluster administrator to view the logs using\n<em>kubectl</em>. This is especially useful with Windows nodes where you run into the\nissue of the node going to the ready state but containers not coming up due to\nCNI misconfigurations and other issues that are not easily identifiable by\nlooking at the Pod status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>The kubelet already has a <em>/var/log/</em> viewer that is accessible via the node\nproxy endpoint. The feature supplements this endpoint with a shim that shells\nout to <code>journalctl</code>, on Linux nodes, and the <code>Get-WinEvent</code> cmdlet on Windows\nnodes. It then uses the existing filters provided by the commands to allow\nfiltering the logs. The kubelet also uses heuristics to retrieve the logs.\nIf the user is not aware if a given system services logs to a file or to the\nnative system logger, the heuristics first checks the native operating system\nlogger and if that is not available it attempts to retrieve the first logs\nfrom <code>/var/log/&lt;servicename&gt;</code> or <code>/var/log/&lt;servicename&gt;.log</code> or\n<code>/var/log/&lt;servicename&gt;/&lt;servicename&gt;.log</code>.</p>\n<p>On Linux we assume that service logs are available via journald, and that\n<code>journalctl</code> is installed. On Windows we assume that service logs are available\nin the application log provider. Also note that fetching node logs is only\navailable if you are authorized to do so (in RBAC, that's <strong>get</strong> and\n<strong>create</strong> access to <code>nodes/proxy</code>). The privileges that you need to fetch node\nlogs also allow elevation-of-privilege attacks, so be careful about how you\nmanage them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>To use the feature, ensure that the <code>NodeLogQuery</code>\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a> is\nenabled for that node, and that the kubelet configuration options\n<code>enableSystemLogHandler</code> and <code>enableSystemLogQuery</code> are both set to true. You can\nthen query the logs from all your nodes or just a subset. Here is an example to\nretrieve the kubelet service logs from a node:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#080;font-style:italic\"># Fetch kubelet logs from a node named node-1.example</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>kubectl get --raw <span style=\"color:#b44\">&#34;/api/v1/nodes/node-1.example/proxy/logs/?query=kubelet&#34;</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can further filter the query to narrow down the results:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#080;font-style:italic\"># Fetch kubelet logs from a node named node-1.example that have the word &#34;error&#34;</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>kubectl get --raw <span style=\"color:#b44\">&#34;/api/v1/nodes/node-1.example/proxy/logs/?query=kubelet&amp;pattern=error&#34;</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can also fetch files from <code>/var/log/</code> on a Linux node:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>kubectl get --raw <span style=\"color:#b44\">&#34;/api/v1/nodes/&lt;insert-node-name-here&gt;/proxy/logs/?query=/&lt;insert-log-file-name-here&gt;&#34;</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can read the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/#log-query\">documentation</a>\nfor all the available options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-help\">How do I help?</h2>\n<p>Please use the feature and provide feedback by opening GitHub issues or\nreaching out to us on the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0SJ4AFB7\">#sig-windows</a> channel on the\nKubernetes Slack or the SIG Windows\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-windows\">mailing list</a>.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-04-21 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/21/node-log-query-alpha/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":3473,"Title":"Enhance SOC workflows with Elastic Security and Recorded Future threat intelligence","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-04-21 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/soc-workflows-elastic-security-recorded-future-threat-intelligence","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3474,"Title":"Elastic joins CISA’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) to defend against US cyber threats","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-04-21 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-joins-jcdc-defend-against-cyber-threats","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3465,"Title":"Amazon S3 Compatible Storage on AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized Devices Now Generally Available","Description":"We have added a collection of purpose-built services to the AWS Snow Family for customers, such as Snowball Edge in 2016 and Snowcone in 2020.
