However, one challenge it presents is the deletion\nof resources that are no longer needed. In Kubernetes version 1.5, the <code>--prune</code> flag was\nintroduced to address this issue, allowing kubectl apply to automatically clean up previously\napplied resources removed from the current configuration.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that existing implementation of <code>--prune</code> has design flaws that diminish its\nperformance and can result in unexpected behaviors. The main issue stems from the lack of explicit\nencoding of the previously applied set by the preceding <code>apply</code> operation, necessitating\nerror-prone dynamic discovery. Object leakage, inadvertent over-selection of resources, and limited\ncompatibility with custom resources are a few notable drawbacks of this implementation. Moreover,\nits coupling to client-side apply hinders user upgrades to the superior server-side apply\nmechanism.</p>\n<p>Version 1.27 of <code>kubectl</code> introduces an alpha version of a revamped pruning implementation that\naddresses these issues. This new implementation, based on a concept called <em>ApplySet</em>, promises\nbetter performance and safety.</p>\n<p>An <em>ApplySet</em> is a group of resources associated with a <em>parent</em> object on the cluster, as\nidentified and configured through standardized labels and annotations. Additional standardized\nmetadata allows for accurate identification of ApplySet <em>member</em> objects within the cluster,\nsimplifying operations like pruning.</p>\n<p>To leverage ApplySet-based pruning, set the <code>KUBECTL_APPLYSET=true</code> environment variable and include\nthe flags <code>--prune</code> and <code>--applyset</code> in your <code>kubectl apply</code> invocation:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#b8860b\">KUBECTL_APPLYSET</span><span style=\"color:#666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#a2f\">true</span> kubectl apply -f &lt;directory/&gt; --prune --applyset<span style=\"color:#666\">=</span>&lt;name&gt;\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>By default, ApplySet uses a Secret as the parent object. However, you can also use\na ConfigMap with the format <code>--applyset=configmaps/&lt;name&gt;</code>. If your desired Secret or\nConfigMap object does not yet exist, <code>kubectl</code> will create it for you. Furthermore, custom\nresources can be enabled for use as ApplySet parent objects.</p>\n<p>The ApplySet implementation is based on a new low-level specification that can support higher-level\necosystem tools by improving their interoperability. The lightweight nature of this specification\nenables these tools to continue to use existing object grouping systems while opting in to\nApplySet's metadata conventions to prevent inadvertent changes by other tools (such as <code>kubectl</code>).</p>\n<p>ApplySet-based pruning offers a promising solution to the shortcomings of the previous <code>--prune</code>\nimplementation in <code>kubectl</code> and can help streamline your Kubernetes resource management. Please\ngive this new feature a try and share your experiences with the community—ApplySet is under active\ndevelopment, and your feedback is invaluable!</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-resources\">Additional resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For more information how to use ApplySet-based pruning, read\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/declarative-config/\">Declarative Management of Kubernetes Objects Using Configuration Files</a> in the Kubernetes documentation.</li>\n<li>For a deeper dive into the technical design of this feature or to learn how to implement the\nApplySet specification in your own tools, refer to <a href=\"https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-cli/3659-kubectl-apply-prune/README.md\">KEP 3659</a>:\n<em>ApplySet: <code>kubectl apply --prune</code> redesign and graduation strategy</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-get-involved\">How do I get involved?</h3>\n<p>If you want to get involved in ApplySet development, you can get in touch with the developers at\n<a href=\"https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-cli\">SIG CLI</a>.

It uses a label selector to group multiple\n<code>PersistentVolumeClaims</code> for snapshotting.\nThis new feature is only supported for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/\">CSI</a> volume drivers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-overview-of-volume-group-snapshots\">An overview of volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of\nmultiple volumes. A group snapshot represents “copies” from multiple volumes that\nare taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate\nnew volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to\na previous state (represented by the snapshots).</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-add-volume-group-snapshots-to-kubernetes\">Why add volume group snapshots to Kubernetes?</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that\nautomates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block\nand file storage.</p>\n<p>Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability:\nKubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and\nunderlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the\ncluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge.</p>\n<p>There is already a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/\">VolumeSnapshot</a> API\nthat provides the ability to take a snapshot of a persistent volume to protect against\ndata loss or data corruption. However, there are other snapshotting functionalities\nnot covered by the VolumeSnapshot API.</p>\n<p>Some storage systems support consistent group snapshots that allow a snapshot to be\ntaken from multiple volumes at the same point-in-time to achieve write order consistency.\nThis can be useful for applications that contain multiple volumes. For example,\nan application may have data stored in one volume and logs stored in another volume.\nIf snapshots for the data volume and the logs volume are taken at different times,\nthe application will not be consistent and will not function properly if it is restored\nfrom those snapshots when a disaster strikes.</p>\n<p>It is true that you can quiesce the application first, take an individual snapshot from\neach volume that is part of the application one after the other, and then unquiesce the\napplication after all the individual snapshots are taken. This way, you would get\napplication consistent snapshots.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes it may not be possible to quiesce an application or the application\nquiesce can be too expensive so you want to do it less frequently. Taking individual\nsnapshots one after another may also take longer time compared to taking a consistent\ngroup snapshot. Some users may not want to do application quiesce very often for these\nreasons. For example, a user may want to run weekly backups with application quiesce\nand nightly backups without application quiesce but with consistent group support which\nprovides crash consistency across all volumes in the group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-volume-group-snapshots-api\">Kubernetes Volume Group Snapshots API</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes Volume Group Snapshots introduce <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/blob/master/client/apis/volumegroupsnapshot/v1alpha1/types.go\">three new API\nobjects</a>\nfor managing snapshots:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>VolumeGroupSnapshot</code></dt>\n<dd>Created by a Kubernetes user (or perhaps by your own automation) to request\ncreation of a volume group snapshot for multiple persistent volume claims.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot operation such as the\ntimestamp when the volume group snapshot was taken and whether it is ready to use.\nThe creation and deletion of this object represents a desire to create or delete a\ncluster resource (a group snapshot).</dd>\n<dt><code>VolumeGroupSnapshotContent</code></dt>\n<dd>Created by the snapshot controller for a dynamically created VolumeGroupSnapshot.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot including the volume group\nsnapshot ID.\nThis object represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a group snapshot).\nThe VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object binds to the VolumeGroupSnapshot for which it\nwas created with a one-to-one mapping.</dd>\n<dt><code>VolumeGroupSnapshotClass</code></dt>\n<dd>Created by cluster administrators to describe how volume group snapshots should be\ncreated. including the driver information, the deletion policy, etc.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These three API kinds are defined as CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs).\nThese CRDs must be installed in a Kubernetes cluster for a CSI Driver to support\nvolume group snapshots.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-kubernetes-volume-group-snapshots\">How do I use Kubernetes Volume Group Snapshots</h2>\n<p>Volume group snapshots are implemented in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter\">external-snapshotter</a> repository. Implementing volume\ngroup snapshots meant adding or changing several components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new CustomResourceDefinitions for VolumeGroupSnapshot and two supporting APIs.</li>\n<li>Volume group snapshot controller logic is added to the common snapshot controller.</li>\n<li>Volume group snapshot validation webhook logic is added to the common snapshot validation webhook.</li>\n<li>Adding logic to make CSI calls into the snapshotter sidecar controller.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The volume snapshot controller, CRDs, and validation webhook are deployed once per\ncluster, while the sidecar is bundled with each CSI driver.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it makes sense to deploy the volume snapshot controller, CRDs, and validation\nwebhook as a cluster addon. I strongly recommend that Kubernetes distributors\nbundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller, CRDs, and validation webhook as part\nof their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver).</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-new-group-snapshot-with-kubernetes\">Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes</h3>\n<p>Once a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass object is defined and you have volumes you want to\nsnapshot together, you may request a new group snapshot by creating a VolumeGroupSnapshot\nobject.</p>\n<p>The source of the group snapshot specifies whether the underlying group snapshot\nshould be dynamically created or if a pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent\nshould be used.</p>\n<p>A pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent is created by a cluster administrator.\nIt contains the details of the real volume group snapshot on the storage system which\nis available for use by cluster users.</p>\n<p>One of the following members in the source of the group snapshot must be set.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>selector</code> - a label query over PersistentVolumeClaims that are to be grouped\ntogether for snapshotting.

group snapshots to my CSI driver?</h2>\n<p>To implement the volume group snapshot feature, a CSI driver <strong>must</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a new group controller service.</li>\n<li>Implement group controller RPCs: <code>CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot</code>, <code>DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot</code>, and <code>GetVolumeGroupSnapshot</code>.</li>\n<li>Add group controller capability <code>CREATE_DELETE_GET_VOLUME_GROUP_SNAPSHOT</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md\">CSI

mechanism to deploy a\ncontainerized CSI driver to simplify the process.</p>\n<p>As part of this recommended deployment process, the Kubernetes team provides a number of\nsidecar (helper) containers, including the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/external-snapshotter.html\">external-snapshotter sidecar container</a>\nwhich has been updated to support volume group snapshot.</p>\n<p>The external-snapshotter watches the Kubernetes API server for the\n<code>VolumeGroupSnapshotContent</code> object and triggers <code>CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot</code> and\n<code>DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot</code> operations against a CSI endpoint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-limitations\">What are the limitations?</h2>\n<p>The alpha implementation of volume group snapshots for Kubernetes has the following\nlimitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does not support reverting an existing PVC to an earlier state represented by\na snapshot (only supports provisioning a new volume from a snapshot).</li>\n<li>No application consistency guarantees beyond any guarantees provided by the storage system\n(e.g. crash consistency). See this <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-data-protection/data-protection-workflows-white-paper.md#quiesce-and-unquiesce-hooks\">doc</a>\nfor more discussions on application consistency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes team plans to push the CSI\nGroup Snapshot implementation to Beta in either 1.28 or 1.29.\nSome of the features we are interested in supporting include volume replication,\nreplication group, volume placement, application quiescing, changed block tracking, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn more?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3476-volume-group-snapshot\">design spec</a>\nfor the volume group snapshot feature.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter\">code repository</a> for volume group\nsnapshot APIs and controller.</li>\n<li>CSI <a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/\">documentation</a> on the group snapshot feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-involved\">How do I get involved?</h2>\n<p>This project, like all of Kubernetes, is the result of hard work by many contributors\nfrom diverse backgrounds working together.
