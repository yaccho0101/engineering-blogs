DNS-level events provide valuable information about network traffic that can be used to identify malicious activity. For instance, monitoring DNS lookups can help you see whether a host on your network attempted to connect to a site known to contain malware. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re pleased to announce that Datadog&rsquo;s eBPF-powered Cloud Workload Security (CWS) now analyzes DNS activity—in addition to file and process activity— to detect security threats in real time.","PublishedAt":"2022-07-01 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/dns-based-threat-detection/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1019,"Title":"Join us at Datadog Summit Sydney","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/datadog-summit-sydney-2022/dd_summit_sydney_hero_04.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Datadog is built on community—from the engineers and SREs whose feedback helps us constantly improve, to the developers who share integrations that broaden the Datadog ecosystem.
