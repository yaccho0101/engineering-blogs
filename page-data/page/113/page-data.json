Kubernetes v1.25 includes several major changes and one major removal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-kubernetes-api-removal-and-deprecation-process\">The Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes project has a well-documented <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">deprecation policy</a> for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes.</li>\n<li>Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after deprecation.</li>\n<li>Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-note-about-podsecuritypolicy\">A Note About PodSecurityPolicy</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.25, we will be removing PodSecurityPolicy <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/\">after its deprecation in v1.21</a>. PodSecurityPolicy has served us honorably, but its complex and often confusing usage necessitated changes, which unfortunately would have been breaking changes. To address this, it is being removed in favor of a replacement, Pod Security Admission, which is graduating to stable in this release as well. If you are currently relying on PodSecurityPolicy, follow the instructions for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/migrate-from-psp/\">migration to Pod Security Admission</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"major-changes-for-kubernetes-v1-25\">Major Changes for Kubernetes v1.25</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.25 includes several major changes, in addition to the removal of PodSecurityPolicy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"csi-migration-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-625\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/625\">CSI Migration</a></h3>\n<p>The effort to move the in-tree volume plugins to out-of-tree CSI drivers continues, with the core CSI Migration feature going GA in v1.25. This is an important step towards removing the in-tree volume plugins entirely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-plugin-deprecations-and-removals\">Volume Plugin Deprecations and Removals</h3>\n<p>Several volume are being deprecated or removed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3446\">GlusterFS will be deprecated in v1.25</a>. While a CSI driver was built for it, it has not been maintained. The possibility of migration to a compatible CSI driver <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/100897\">was discussed</a>, but a decision was ultimately made to begin the deprecation of the GlusterFS plugin from in-tree drivers. The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2589\">Portworx in-tree volume plugin</a> is also being deprecated with this release. The Flocker, Quobyte, and StorageOS in-tree volume plugins are being removed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"declare-unsupported-vsphere-versions-https-github-com-kubernetes-kubernetes-pull-111255\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111255\">Declare Unsupported vSphere Versions</a></h3>\n<p>From Kubernetes v1.25, the in-tree vSphere volume driver will not support any vSphere release before 7.0u2. Check the v1.25 detailed release notes for more advice on how to handle this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"signing-release-artifacts-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-3031\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031\">Signing Release Artifacts</a></h3>\n<p>An additional step in improving the security posture of the release process, the signing of Kubernetes release artifacts will graduate to Beta in this release.

While cgroup v1 will continue to be supported, this change makes us ready to deal with the eventual deprecation of cgroup v1 and its replacement by cgroup v2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleaning-up-iptables-chain-ownership-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-3178\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3178\">Cleaning up IPTables Chain Ownership</a></h3>\n<p>From the Kubernetes 1.25 release, the iptables chains created by Kubernetes will only support for internal Kubernetes use cases.
