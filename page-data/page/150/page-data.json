We revamped our organizational structure, clearly defined the role of a Data Scientist and a Data Engineer, introduced working groups to solve common problems (like this), and positioned ourselves to do incredible work! Most recently, we started thinking about the work that a Data Scientist does, and how best to describe and share the process that we use to work on a business problem. Based on the experiences of our Data Scientists, we distilled a set of steps, tips and general guidance representing the best practices that we collectively know of and agree to as a community of practitioners.","PublishedAt":"2017-10-04 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/soundclouds-data-science-process","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":331,"Title":"GIPHY + NYCML ’17 Workshop","Description":"NYC Media Lab is dedicated to connecting digital media and technology companies with New York City's universities to drive innovation, entrepreneurship and talent development.

To recap, adopting a microservices architecture has allowed us to regain team autonomy by breaking up our monolithic backend into dozens of decoupled services, each encapsulating a well defined portion of our product domain. Every service is built and deployed individually, communicating with other services over the network via light-weight data interchange formats such as JSON or Thrift.\nWhat we haven’t touched on so far is how a microservice at SoundCloud looks backstage.","PublishedAt":"2017-07-28 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/inside-a-soundcloud-microservice","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":342,"Title":"Introducing GIPHY Engineering","Description":"Welcome to our new GIPHY Engineering blog!
