This new registry spreads the load across multiple Cloud Providers &amp; Regions, functioning as a sort of content delivery network (CDN) for Kubernetes container images. This change reduces the project’s reliance on a single entity and provides a faster download experience for a large number of users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tl-dr-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-change\">TL;DR: What you need to know about this change</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Container images for Kubernetes releases from 1.25 onward are no longer published to k8s.gcr.io, only to registry.k8s.io.</li>\n<li>In the upcoming December patch releases, the new registry domain default will be backported to all branches still in support (1.22, 1.23, 1.24).</li>\n<li>If you run in a restricted environment and apply strict domain/IP address access policies limited to k8s.gcr.io, the <strong>image pulls will not function</strong> after the migration to this new registry. For these users, the recommended method is to mirror the release images to a private registry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’d like to know more about why we made this change, or some potential issues you might run into, keep reading.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-has-kubernetes-changed-to-a-different-image-registry\">Why has Kubernetes changed to a different image registry?</h2>\n<p>k8s.gcr.io is hosted on a custom <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/container-registry\">Google Container Registry</a> (GCR) domain that was setup solely for the Kubernetes project. This has worked well since the inception of the project, and we thank Google for providing these resources, but today there are other cloud providers and vendors that would like to host images to provide a better experience for the people on their platforms. In addition to Google’s <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/google-cloud-recommits-3m-to-kubernetes/\">renewed commitment to donate $3 million</a> to support the project's infrastructure, Amazon announced a matching donation during their Kubecon NA 2022 keynote in Detroit. This will provide a better experience for users (closer servers = faster downloads) and will reduce the egress bandwidth and costs from GCR at the same time. registry.k8s.io will spread the load between Google and Amazon, with other providers to follow in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-isn-t-there-a-stable-list-of-domains-ips-why-can-t-i-restrict-image-pulls\">Why isn’t there a stable list of domains/IPs? Why can’t I restrict image pulls?</h2>\n<p>registry.k8s.io is a <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io/blob/main/cmd/archeio/docs/request-handling.md\">secure blob redirector</a> that connects clients to the closest cloud provider. The nature of this change means that a client pulling an image could be redirected to any one of a large number of backends. We expect the set of backends to keep changing and will only increase as more and more cloud providers and vendors come on board to help mirror the release images.</p>\n<p>Restrictive control mechanisms like man-in-the-middle proxies or network policies that restrict access to a specific list of IPs/domains will break with this change. For these scenarios, we encourage you to mirror the release images to a local registry that you have strict control over.</p>\n<p>For more information on this policy, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io#stability\">stability section of the registry.k8s.io documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-kind-of-errors-will-i-see-how-will-i-know-if-i-m-still-using-the-old-address\">What kind of errors will I see?
