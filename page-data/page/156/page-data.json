At its core it seems simple enough: a piece of text associated with a point in time for a particular track. But where you see timed opinions, I see a light-weight game scripting engine. So when Johannes Wagener told me he was adding an  event to our JS SDK, I immediately began work on Wave Raid: Quest for the Timed Comment.","PublishedAt":"2012-04-05 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/wave-raid","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":914,"Title":"Developer Contest: SoundCloud + Acapela Group Mashup","Description":"SoundCloud is teaming up with Acapela Group for\nour first Developer Contest.

Our old Python API wrapper has been neglected. It doesn’t support OAuth 2 or all of the resources made available by our API. It’s old and crufty and we’re sorry for letting it get that way.

This is just a tribute. I was approached by Tenacious D a week ago with an incredible quest: raising a phallus shaped phoenix onto the internet (oh and the first clip of audio from their new record.) How could I raise this majestic beast with the power of SoundCloud’s legendary API?

They encourage original content creation and tend to be extremely viral due to the high level of self-promotion involved with participating. The infrastructure you choose to throw these contests on should be accessible from any device while also providing a nice aesthetic backdrop to apply your branding. Users should be able to submit, vote, and comment no matter where they’re coming from: Web, iPhone, Facebook Tab, etc. Today we’re putting forth an open-source app called Competition which we think is a great solution to the problem.","PublishedAt":"2011-11-14 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/competition-app","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":930,"Title":"Music Hack Day Boston 2011","Description":"Last weekend was another successful Music Hack Day Boston jam-packed with cool hacks, and hackers alike.
