For Kubernetes v1.26 there are several planned: this article identifies and describes some of them, based on the information available at this mid-cycle point in the v1.26 release process, which is still ongoing and can introduce additional changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"k8s-api-deprecation-process\">The Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes project has a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">well-documented deprecation policy</a> for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes.</li>\n<li>Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after deprecation.</li>\n<li>Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cri-api-removal\">A note about the removal of the CRI <code>v1alpha2</code> API and containerd 1.5 support</h2>\n<p>Following the adoption of the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">Container Runtime Interface</a> (CRI) and the [removal of dockershim] in v1.24 , the CRI is the supported and documented way through which Kubernetes interacts withdifferent container runtimes. Each kubelet negotiates which version of CRI to use with the container runtime on that node.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends using CRI version <code>v1</code>; in Kubernetes v1.25 the kubelet can also negotiate the use of CRI <code>v1alpha2</code> (which was deprecated along at the same time as adding support for the stable <code>v1</code> interface).</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.26 will not support CRI <code>v1alpha2</code>. That <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110618\">removal</a> will result in the kubelet not registering the node if the container runtime doesn't support CRI <code>v1</code>. This means that containerd minor version 1.5 and older will not be supported in Kubernetes 1.26; if you use containerd, you will need to upgrade to containerd version 1.6.0 or later <strong>before</strong> you upgrade that node to Kubernetes v1.26. Other container runtimes that only support the <code>v1alpha2</code> are equally affected: if that affects you, you should contact the container runtime vendor for advice or check their website for additional instructions in how to move forward.</p>\n<p>If you want to benefit from v1.26 features and still use an older container runtime, you can run an older kubelet. The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/#kubelet\">supported skew</a> for the kubelet allows you to run a v1.25 kubelet, which still is still compatible with <code>v1alpha2</code> CRI support, even if you upgrade the control plane to the 1.26 minor release of Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>As well as container runtimes themselves, that there are tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter\">stargz-snapshotter</a> that act as a proxy between kubelet and container runtime and those also might be affected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deprecations-removals\">Deprecations and removals in Kubernetes v1.26</h2>\n<p>In addition to the above, Kubernetes v1.26 is targeted to include several additional removals and deprecations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-the-v1beta1-flow-control-api-group\">Removal of the <code>v1beta1</code> flow control API group</h3>\n<p>The <code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#flowcontrol-resources-v126\">will no longer be served in v1.26</a>. Users should migrate manifests and API clients to use the <code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta2</code> API version, available since v1.23.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-the-v2beta2-horizontalpodautoscaler-api\">Removal of the <code>v2beta2</code> HorizontalPodAutoscaler API</h3>\n<p>The <code>autoscaling/v2beta2</code> API version of HorizontalPodAutoscaler <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#horizontalpodautoscaler-v126\">will no longer be served in v1.26</a>.
