And as your teams expand, it also becomes more important to quickly bring teammates up to speed with new data sources and product areas to ensure uptime.","PublishedAt":"2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/standardize-dashboards-powerpacks-datadog/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":16,"Title":"New – Amazon EC2 R6a Instances Powered by 3rd Gen AMD EPYC Processors for Memory-Intensive Workloads","Description":"We launched the general-purpose Amazon EC2 M6a instances at AWS re:Invent 2021 and compute-intensive C6a instances in February of this year.
