It allows to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks directly on\nthe client side and therefore ensures the trustfulness of the remote serving the\nartifacts. The overall goal of out past work was to define the used tooling for\nsigning all Kubernetes related artifacts as well as providing a standard signing\nprocess for related projects (for example for those in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs\">kubernetes-sigs</a>).</p>\n<p>We already signed all officially released container images (from Kubernetes v1.24 onwards).\nImage signing was alpha for v1.24 and v1.25. For v1.26, we've added all\n<strong>binary artifacts</strong> to the signing process as well! This means that now all\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.26/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md#downloads-for-v1260\">client, server and source tarballs</a>, <a href=\"https://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-release/release/v1.26.0/bin\">binary artifacts</a>,\n<a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.26.0/kubernetes-release.spdx\">Software Bills of Material (SBOMs)</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.26.0/provenance.json\">build\nprovenance</a> will be signed using <a href=\"https://github.com/sigstore/cosign\">cosign</a>. Technically\nspeaking, we now ship additional <code>*.sig</code> (signature) and <code>*.cert</code> (certificate)\nfiles side by side to the artifacts for verifying their integrity.</p>\n<p>To verify an artifact, for example <code>kubectl</code>, you can download the\nsignature and certificate alongside with the binary.

We also have twelve features being\ndeprecated or removed, three of which we better detail in this announcement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-theme-and-logo\">Release theme and logo</h2>\n<p><strong>Kubernetes 1.26: Electrifying</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"release-logo\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2022-12-08-kubernetes-1.26-release/kubernetes-1.26.png\"\nalt=\"Kubernetes 1.26 Electrifying logo\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>The theme for Kubernetes v1.26 is <em>Electrifying</em>.</p>\n<p>Each Kubernetes release is the result of the coordinated effort of dedicated volunteers, and only\nmade possible due to the use of a diverse and complex set of computing resources, spread out through\nmultiple datacenters and regions worldwide. The end result of a release - the binaries, the image\ncontainers, the documentation - are then deployed on a growing number of personal, on-premises, and\ncloud computing resources.</p>\n<p>In this release we want to recognise the importance of all these building blocks on which Kubernetes\nis developed and used, while at the same time raising awareness on the importance of taking the\nenergy consumption footprint into account: environmental sustainability is an inescapable concern of\ncreators and users of any software solution, and the environmental footprint of sofware, like\nKubernetes, an area which we believe will play a significant role in future releases.</p>\n<p>As a community, we always work to make each new release process better than before (in this release,\nwe have <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/98/views/1\">started to use Projects for tracking\nenhancements</a>, for example). If <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/03/kubernetes-1-24-release-announcement/\">v1.24\n&quot;Stargazer&quot;</a> <em>had us looking upwards, to\nwhat is possible when our community comes together</em>, and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/23/kubernetes-v1-25-release/\">v1.25\n&quot;Combiner&quot;</a> <em>what the combined efforts of our community\nare capable of</em>, this v1.26 &quot;Electrifying&quot; is also dedicated to all of those whose individual\nmotion, integrated into the release flow, made all of this possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"major-themes\">Major themes</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.26 is composed of many changes, brought to you by a worldwide team of volunteers. For\nthis release, we have identified several major themes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"change-in-container-image-registry\">Change in container image registry</h3>\n<p>In the previous release, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109938\">Kubernetes changed the container\nregistry</a>, allowing the spread of the load\nacross multiple Cloud Providers and Regions, a change that reduced the reliance on a single entity\nand provided a faster download experience for a large number of users.</p>\n<p>This release of Kubernetes is the first that is exclusively published in the new <code>registry.k8s.io</code>\ncontainer image registry. In the (now legacy) <code>k8s.gcr.io</code> image registry, no container images tags\nfor v1.26 will be published, and only tags from releases before v1.26 will continue to be\nupdated. Refer to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/11/28/registry-k8s-io-faster-cheaper-ga/\">registry.k8s.io: faster, cheaper and Generally\nAvailable</a> for more information on the\nmotivation, advantages, and implications of this significant change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cri-v1alpha2-removed\">CRI v1alpha2 removed</h3>\n<p>With the adoption of the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">Container Runtime Interface</a> (CRI) and\nthe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/02/17/dockershim-faq/\">removal of dockershim</a> in v1.24, the CRI is the only\nsupported and documented way through which Kubernetes interacts with different container\nruntimes. Each kubelet negotiates which version of CRI to use with the container runtime on that\nnode.</p>\n<p>In the previous release, the Kubernetes project recommended using CRI version <code>v1</code>, but kubelet\ncould still negotiate the use of CRI <code>v1alpha2</code>, which was deprecated.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.26 drops support for CRI <code>v1alpha2</code>. That\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110618\">removal</a> will result in the kubelet not\nregistering the node if the container runtime doesn't support CRI <code>v1</code>. This means that containerd\nminor version 1.5 and older are not supported in Kubernetes 1.26; if you use containerd, you will\nneed to upgrade to containerd version 1.6.0 or later <strong>before</strong> you upgrade that node to Kubernetes\nv1.26. This applies equally to any other container runtimes that only support the <code>v1alpha2</code>: if\nthat affects you, you should contact the container runtime vendor for advice or check their website\nfor additional instructions in how to move forward.</p>\n<h3 id=\"storage-improvements\">Storage improvements</h3>\n<p>Following the GA of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/625-csi-migration\">core Container Storage Interface (CSI)\nMigration</a>\nfeature in the previous release, CSI migration is an on-going effort that we've been working on for\na few releases now, and this release continues to add (and remove) features aligned with the\nmigration's goals, as well as other improvements to Kubernetes storage.</p>\n<h4 id=\"csi-migration-for-azure-file-and-vsphere-graduated-to-stable\">CSI migration for Azure File and vSphere graduated to stable</h4>\n<p>Both the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1491\">vSphere</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1885\">Azure</a> in-tree driver migration to CSI have\ngraduated to Stable. You can find more information about them in the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/vsphere-csi-driver\">vSphere CSI\ndriver</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurefile-csi-driver\">Azure File CSI\ndriver</a> repositories.</p>\n<h4 id=\"delegate-fsgroup-to-csi-driver-graduated-to-stable\"><em>Delegate FSGroup to CSI Driver</em> graduated to stable</h4>\n<p>This feature allows Kubernetes to <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2317\">supply the pod's <code>fsGroup</code> to the CSI driver when a volume is\nmounted</a> so that the driver can utilize\nmount options to control volume permissions. Previously, the kubelet would always apply the\n<code>fsGroup</code>ownership and permission change to files in the volume according to the policy specified in\nthe Pod's <code>.spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy</code> field. Starting with this release, CSI\ndrivers have the option to apply the <code>fsGroup</code> settings during attach or mount time of the volumes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-tree-glusterfs-driver-removal\">In-tree GlusterFS driver removal</h4>\n<p>Already deprecated in the v1.25 release, the in-tree GlusterFS driver was\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3446\">removed</a> in this release.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-tree-openstack-cinder-driver-removal\">In-tree OpenStack Cinder driver removal</h4>\n<p>This release removed the deprecated in-tree storage integration for OpenStack (the <code>cinder</code> volume\ntype). You should migrate to external cloud provider and CSI driver from\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack\">https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack</a> instead.

All release artifacts are signed\nkeyless using <a href=\"https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/\">cosign</a>, and both binary artifacts and images\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/verify-signed-artifacts/\">can be verified</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-windows-privileged-containers-graduates-to-stable\">Support for Windows privileged containers graduates to stable</h3>\n<p>Privileged container support allows containers to run with similar access to the host as processes\nthat run on the host directly. Support for this feature in Windows nodes, called <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/create-hostprocess-pod/\">HostProcess\ncontainers</a>, will now <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1981\">graduate to Stable</a>,\nenabling access to host resources (including network resources) from privileged containers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improvements-to-kubernetes-metrics\">Improvements to Kubernetes metrics</h3>\n<p>This release has several noteworthy improvements on metrics.</p>\n<h4 id=\"metrics-framework-extension-graduates-to-alpha\">Metrics framework extension graduates to alpha</h4>\n<p>The metrics framework extension <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3498\">graduates to\nAlpha</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/metrics/\">documentation is now published for every metric in the\nKubernetes codebase</a>.This enhancement adds two additional metadata\nfields to Kubernetes metrics: <code>Internal</code> and <code>Beta</code>, representing different stages of metric maturity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"component-health-service-level-indicators-graduates-to-alpha\">Component Health Service Level Indicators graduates to alpha</h4>\n<p>Also improving on the ability to consume Kubernetes metrics, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/slis/\">component health Service Level\nIndicators (SLIs)</a> have <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112884\">graduated to\nAlpha</a>: by enabling the <code>ComponentSLIs</code>\nfeature flag there will be an additional metrics endpoint which allows the calculation of Service\nLevel Objectives (SLOs) from raw healthcheck data converted into metric format.</p>\n<h4 id=\"feature-metrics-are-now-available\">Feature metrics are now available</h4>\n<p>Feature metrics are now available for each Kubernetes component, making it possible to <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112690\">track\nwhether each active feature gate is enabled</a>\nby checking the component's metric endpoint for <code>kubernetes_feature_enabled</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-resource-allocation-graduates-to-alpha\">Dynamic Resource Allocation graduates to alpha</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/\">Dynamic Resource\nAllocation</a>\nis a <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/3063-dynamic-resource-allocation/README.md\">new feature</a>\nthat puts resource scheduling in the hands of third-party developers: it offers an\nalternative to the limited &quot;countable&quot; interface for requesting access to resources\n(e.g. <code>nvidia.com/gpu: 2</code>), providing an API more akin to that of persistent volumes. Under the\nhood, it uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface\">Container Device\nInterface</a> (CDI) to do\nits device injection. This feature is blocked by the <code>DynamicResourceAllocation</code> feature gate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cel-in-admission-control-graduates-to-alpha\">CEL in Admission Control graduates to alpha</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3488\">This feature</a> introduces a <code>v1alpha1</code> API for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">validating admission\npolicies</a>, enabling extensible admission\ncontrol via <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cel-spec\">Common Expression Language</a> expressions. Currently,\ncustom policies are enforced via <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/\">admission\nwebhooks</a>,\nwhich, while flexible, have a few drawbacks when compared to in-process policy enforcement. To use,\nenable the <code>ValidatingAdmissionPolicy</code> feature gate and the <code>admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1</code>\nAPI via <code>--runtime-config</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-scheduling-improvements\">Pod scheduling improvements</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.26 introduces some relevant enhancements to the ability to better control scheduling\nbehavior.</p>\n<h4 id=\"podschedulingreadiness-graduates-to-alpha\"><code>PodSchedulingReadiness</code> graduates to alpha</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3521\">This feature</a> introduces a <code>.spec.schedulingGates</code>\nfield to Pod's API, to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-scheduling-readiness/\">indicate whether the Pod is allowed to be scheduled or not</a>.
