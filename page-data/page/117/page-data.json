As a CNI provider, Cilium extends the orchestrator&rsquo;s existing network capabilities by giving teams more control over how they build their applications and monitor traffic. For example, vanilla Kubernetes installations typically rely on traditional firewalls and Linux-based network utilities like iptables to filter pod-to-pod traffic by an IP address or port. But managing network communication with standard firewall rules is more difficult when these environments experience high rates of churn among pods—and consequently IP addresses.","PublishedAt":"2022-07-25 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/cilium-metrics-and-architecture/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1011,"Title":"Monitor Cilium and Kubernetes performance with Hubble","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/monitor-cilium-and-kubernetes-performance-with-hubble/cilium_part2_hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>In Part 1, we looked at some key metrics for monitoring the health and performance of your Cilium-managed Kubernetes clusters and network.

Cilium also integrates with various standalone monitoring tools, so you can track the other key metrics discussed in Part 1. But since the platform is an integral part of your infrastructure, you need the ability to easily correlate Cilium network and resource metrics with data from your Kubernetes resources.","PublishedAt":"2022-07-25 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitor-cilium-cni-with-datadog/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":545,"Title":"The Overflow #135: Money that moves at the speed of information","Description":"<p>Money that moves at the speed of information, a conversation with Stack Overflow's new CTO Jody Bailey, and and exploring how Rust manages memory.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/07/22/the-overflow-135/\">The Overflow #135: Money that moves at the speed of information</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog\">Stack Overflow Blog</a>.</p>\n","PublishedAt":"2022-07-22 13:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/07/22/the-overflow-135/","SourceName":"Stack Overflow"}},{"node":{"ID":546,"Title":"Game Boy emulators, PowerPoint developers, and the enduring appeal of Pokémon GO (Ep. 466)","Description":"<p>The home team talks game development and PowerPoint, the good ol’ days of Game Boy, and wild facts about the largest species in the deer family.
