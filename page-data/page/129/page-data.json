New features may offer\nan alternative or improved approach to solving existing problems, motivating the team to remove the\nold approach.</p>\n<p>We want to make sure you are aware of the changes coming in the Kubernetes 1.24 release. The release will\n<strong>deprecate</strong> several (beta) APIs in favor of stable versions of the same APIs. The major change coming\nin the Kubernetes 1.24 release is the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2221-remove-dockershim\">removal of Dockershim</a>.\nThis is discussed below and will be explored in more depth at release time. For an early look at the\nchanges coming in Kubernetes 1.24, take a look at the in-progress\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md\">CHANGELOG</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-note-about-dockershim\">A note about Dockershim</h2>\n<p>It's safe to say that the removal receiving the most attention with the release of Kubernetes 1.24\nis Dockershim. Dockershim was deprecated in v1.20. As noted in the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md#deprecation\">Kubernetes 1.20 changelog</a>:\n&quot;Docker support in the kubelet is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The kubelet\nuses a module called &quot;dockershim&quot; which implements CRI support for Docker and it has seen maintenance\nissues in the Kubernetes community.&quot; With the upcoming release of Kubernetes 1.24, the Dockershim will\nfinally be removed.</p>\n<p>In the article <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/\">Don't Panic: Kubernetes and Docker</a>,\nthe authors succinctly captured the change's impact and encouraged users to remain calm:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Docker as an underlying runtime is being deprecated in favor of runtimes that use the\nContainer Runtime Interface (CRI) created for Kubernetes. Docker-produced images\nwill continue to work in your cluster with all runtimes, as they always have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Several guides have been created with helpful information about migrating from dockershim\nto container runtimes that are directly compatible with Kubernetes. You can find them on the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/\">Migrating from dockershim</a>\npage in the Kubernetes documentation.</p>\n<p>For more information about why Kubernetes is moving away from dockershim, check out the aptly\nnamed: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/01/07/kubernetes-is-moving-on-from-dockershim/\">Kubernetes is Moving on From Dockershim</a>\nand the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/02/17/dockershim-faq/\">updated dockershim removal FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/03/31/ready-for-dockershim-removal/\">Is Your Cluster Ready for v1.24?</a> post to learn about how to ensure your cluster continues to work after upgrading from v1.23 to v1.24.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-kubernetes-api-removal-and-deprecation-process\">The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes contains a large number of components that evolve over time. In some cases, this\nevolution results in APIs, flags, or entire features, being removed. To prevent users from facing\nbreaking changes, Kubernetes contributors adopted a feature <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">deprecation policy</a>.\nThis policy ensures that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer stable version of that\nsame API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime as indicated by the following stability levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes.</li>\n<li>Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after deprecation.</li>\n<li>Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Removals follow the same deprecation policy regardless of whether an API is removed due to a beta feature\ngraduating to stable or because that API was not proven to be successful. Kubernetes will continue to make\nsure migration options are documented whenever APIs are removed.</p>\n<p><strong>Deprecated</strong> APIs are those that have been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. <strong>Removed</strong>\nAPIs are those that are no longer available for use in current, supported Kubernetes versions after having\nbeen deprecated. These removals have been superseded by newer, stable/generally available (GA) APIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"api-removals-deprecations-and-other-changes-for-kubernetes-1-24\">API removals, deprecations, and other changes for Kubernetes 1.24</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/281\">Dynamic kubelet configuration</a>: <code>DynamicKubeletConfig</code> is used to enable the dynamic configuration of the kubelet. The <code>DynamicKubeletConfig</code> flag was deprecated in Kubernetes 1.22. In v1.24, this feature gate will be removed from the kubelet. See <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reconfigure-kubelet/\">Reconfigure kubelet</a>. Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/281\">&quot;Dynamic kubelet config is removed&quot; KEP</a> for more information.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107207\">Dynamic log sanitization</a>: The experimental dynamic log sanitization feature is deprecated and will be removed in v1.24. This feature introduced a logging filter that could be applied to all Kubernetes system components logs to prevent various types of sensitive information from leaking via logs. Refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/1753-logs-sanitization#deprecation\">KEP-1753: Kubernetes system components logs sanitization</a> for more information and an <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/1753-logs-sanitization#alternatives=\">alternative approach</a>.</li>\n<li>In-tree provisioner to CSI driver migration: This applies to a number of in-tree plugins, including <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2589\">Portworx</a>.

It was deprecated in v1.20. As of v1.24, the kubelet will no longer have dockershim. Check out this blog on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/03/31/ready-for-dockershim-removal/\">what you need to do be ready for v1.24</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1472\">Storage capacity tracking for pod scheduling</a>: The CSIStorageCapacity API supports exposing currently available storage capacity via CSIStorageCapacity objects and enhances scheduling of pods that use CSI volumes with late binding. In v1.24, the CSIStorageCapacity API will be stable. The API graduating to stable initates the deprecation of the v1beta1 CSIStorageCapacity API. Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/1472-storage-capacity-tracking\">Storage Capacity Constraints for Pod Scheduling KEP</a> for more information.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107533\">The <code>master</code> label is no longer present on kubeadm control plane nodes</a>. For new clusters, the label 'node-role.kubernetes.io/master' will no longer be added to control plane nodes, only the label 'node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane' will be added.

Volume snapshot and restore functionality for Kubernetes and the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md\">Container Storage Interface</a> (CSI), which provides standardized APIs design (CRDs) and adds PV snapshot/restore support for CSI volume drivers, moved to GA in v1.20. VolumeSnapshot v1beta1 was deprecated in v1.20 and will become unsupported with the v1.24 release. Refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/177-volume-snapshot#kep-177-csi-snapshot\">KEP-177: CSI Snapshot</a> and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/10/kubernetes-1.20-volume-snapshot-moves-to-ga/\">Volume Snapshot GA blog</a> blog article for more information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-do\">What to do</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dockershim-removal\">Dockershim removal</h3>\n<p>As stated earlier, there are several guides about\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/\">Migrating from dockershim</a>.\nYou can start with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/find-out-runtime-you-use/\">Finding what container runtime are on your nodes</a>.\nIf your nodes are using dockershim, there are other possible Docker Engine dependencies such as\nPods or third-party tools executing Docker commands or private registries in the Docker configuration file.

In Kubernetes, dockershim is a software shim that allows you to use the entire Docker engine as your container runtime within Kubernetes. In the upcoming v1.24 release, we are removing Dockershim - the delay between deprecation and removal in line with the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">project’s policy</a> of supporting features for at least one year after deprecation. If you are a cluster operator, this guide includes the practical realities of what you need to know going into this release. Also, what do you need to do to ensure your cluster doesn’t fall over!</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-does-this-even-affect-you\">First, does this even affect you?</h2>\n<p>If you are rolling your own cluster or are otherwise unsure whether or not this removal affects you, stay on the safe side and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/check-if-dockershim-removal-affects-you/\">check to see if you have any dependencies on Docker Engine</a>. Please note that using Docker Desktop to build your application containers is not a Docker dependency for your cluster. Container images created by Docker are compliant with the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>, a Linux Foundation governance structure that defines industry standards around container formats and runtimes. They will work just fine on any container runtime supported by Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>If you are using a managed Kubernetes service from a cloud provider, and you haven’t explicitly changed the container runtime, there may be nothing else for you to do. Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, and Google GKE all default to containerd now, though you should make sure they do not need updating if you have any node customizations. To check the runtime of your nodes, follow <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/find-out-runtime-you-use/\">Find Out What Container Runtime is Used on a Node</a>.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether you are rolling your own cluster or using a managed Kubernetes service from a cloud provider, you may need to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/migrating-telemetry-and-security-agents/\">migrate telemetry or security agents that rely on Docker Engine</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-have-a-docker-dependency-what-now\">I have a Docker dependency. What now?</h2>\n<p>If your Kubernetes cluster depends on Docker Engine and you intend to upgrade to Kubernetes v1.24 (which you should eventually do for security and similar reasons), you will need to change your container runtime from Docker Engine to something else or use <a href=\"https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd\">cri-dockerd</a>. Since <a href=\"https://containerd.io/\">containerd</a> is a graduated CNCF project and the runtime within Docker itself, it’s a safe bet as an alternative container runtime. Fortunately, the Kubernetes project has already documented the process of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/change-runtime-containerd/\">changing a node’s container runtime</a>, using containerd as an example. Instructions are similar for switching to one of the other supported runtimes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-want-to-upgrade-kubernetes-and-i-need-to-maintain-compatibility-with-docker-as-a-runtime-what-are-my-options\">I want to upgrade Kubernetes, and I need to maintain compatibility with Docker as a runtime. What are my options?</h2>\n<p>Fear not, you aren’t being left out in the cold and you don’t have to take the security risk of staying on an old version of Kubernetes. Mirantis and Docker have jointly released, and are maintaining, a replacement for dockershim. That replacement is called <a href=\"https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd\">cri-dockerd</a>. If you do need to maintain compatibility with Docker as a runtime, install cri-dockerd following the instructions in the project’s documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-that-it\">Is that it?</h2>\n<p>Yes. As long as you go into this release aware of the changes being made and the details of your own clusters, and you make sure to communicate clearly with your development teams, it will be minimally dramatic. You may have some changes to make to your cluster, application code, or scripts, but all of these requirements are documented. Switching from using Docker Engine as your runtime to using <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/\">one of the other supported container runtimes</a> effectively means removing the middleman, since the purpose of dockershim is to access the container runtime used by Docker itself.
