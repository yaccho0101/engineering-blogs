It acknowledged that cluster administrators and\ncluster users are usually not the same people, and that creating workloads in\nthe form of a Pod or any resource that will create a Pod should not equal being\n&quot;root on the cluster&quot;. It could also encourage best practices by configuring\nmore secure defaults through mutation and decoupling low-level Linux security\ndecisions from the deployment process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-birth-of-podsecuritypolicy\">The birth of PodSecurityPolicy</h2>\n<p>PodSecurityPolicy originated from OpenShift's SecurityContextConstraints\n(SCC) that were in the very first release of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform,\neven before Kubernetes 1.0. PSP was a stripped-down version of the SCC.</p>\n<p>The origin of the creation of PodSecurityPolicy is difficult to track, notably\nbecause it was mainly added before Kubernetes Enhancements Proposal (KEP)\nprocess, when design proposals were still a thing. Indeed, the archive of the final\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/auth/pod-security-policy.md\">design proposal</a>\nis still available. Nevertheless, a <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/5\">KEP issue number five</a>\nwas created after the first pull requests were merged.</p>\n<p>Before adding the first piece of code that created PSP, two main pull\nrequests were merged into Kubernetes, a <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/7343\"><code>SecurityContext</code> subresource</a>\nthat defined new fields on pods' containers, and the first iteration of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/7101\">ServiceAccount</a>\nAPI.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes 1.0 was released on 10 July 2015 without any mechanism to restrict the\nsecurity context and sensitive options of workloads, other than an alpha-quality\nSecurityContextDeny admission plugin (then known as <code>scdeny</code>).\nThe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#securitycontextdeny\">SecurityContextDeny plugin</a>\nis still in Kubernetes today (as an alpha feature) and creates an admission controller that\nprevents the usage of some fields in the security context.</p>\n<p>The roots of the PodSecurityPolicy were added with\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/7893\">the very first pull request on security policy</a>,\nwhich added the design proposal with the new PSP object, based on the SCC (Security Context Constraints). It\nwas a long discussion of nine months, with back and forth from OpenShift's SCC,\nmany rebases, and the rename to PodSecurityPolicy that finally made it to\nupstream Kubernetes in February 2016. Now that the PSP object\nhad been created, the next step was to add an admission controller that could enforce\nthese policies. The first step was to add the admission\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/7893#issuecomment-180410539\">without taking into account the users or groups</a>.\nA specific <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/23217\">issue to bring PodSecurityPolicy to a usable state</a>\nwas added to keep track of the progress and a first version of the admission\ncontroller was merged in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/24600\">pull request named PSP admission</a>\nin May 2016. Then around two months later, Kubernetes 1.3 was released.</p>\n<p>Here is a timeline that recaps the main pull requests of the birth of the\nPodSecurityPolicy and its admission controller with 1.0 and 1.3 releases as\nreference points.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"./timeline.svg\"\nalt=\"Timeline of the PodSecurityPolicy creation pull requests\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>After that, the PSP admission controller was enhanced by adding what was initially\nleft aside. <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/33080\">The authorization mechanism</a>,\nmerged in early November 2016 allowed administrators to use multiple policies\nin a cluster to grant different levels of access for different types of users.\nLater, a <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52849\">pull request</a>\nmerged in October 2017 fixed <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/36184\">a design issue</a>\non ordering PodSecurityPolicies between mutating and alphabetical order, and continued to\nbuild the PSP admission as we know it. After that, many improvements and fixes\nfollowed to build the PodSecurityPolicy feature of recent Kubernetes releases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-rise-of-pod-security-admission\">The rise of Pod Security Admission</h2>\n<p>Despite the crucial issue it was trying to solve, PodSecurityPolicy presented\nsome major flaws:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flawed authorization model</strong> - users can create a pod if they have the\n<strong>use</strong> verb on the PSP that allows that pod or the pod's service account has\nthe <strong>use</strong> permission on the allowing PSP.</li>\n<li><strong>Difficult to roll out</strong> - PSP fail-closed. That is, in the absence of a policy,\nall pods are denied. It mostly means that it cannot be enabled by default and\nthat users have to add PSPs for all workloads before enabling the feature,\nthus providing no audit mode to discover which pods would not be allowed by\nthe new policy. The opt-in model also leads to insufficient test coverage and\nfrequent breakage due to cross-feature incompatibility. And unlike RBAC,\nthere was no strong culture of shipping PSP manifests with projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Inconsistent unbounded API</strong> - the API has grown with lots of\ninconsistencies notably because of many requests for niche use cases: e.g.\nlabels, scheduling, fine-grained volume controls, etc. It has poor\ncomposability with a weak prioritization model, leading to unexpected\nmutation priority. It made it really difficult to combine PSP with other\nthird-party admission controllers.</li>\n<li><strong>Require security knowledge</strong> - effective usage still requires an\nunderstanding of Linux security primitives. e.g. MustRunAsNonRoot +\nAllowPrivilegeEscalation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The experience with PodSecurityPolicy concluded that most users care for two or three\npolicies, which led to the creation of the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/\">Pod Security Standards</a>,\nthat define three policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privileged</strong> - unrestricted policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Baseline</strong> - minimally restrictive policy, allowing the default pod\nconfiguration.</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted</strong> - security best practice policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The replacement for PSP, the new <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/\">Pod Security Admission</a>\nis an in-tree, stable for Kubernetes v1.25, admission plugin to enforce these\nstandards at the namespace level. It makes it easier to enforce basic pod\nsecurity without deep security knowledge. For more sophisticated use cases, you\nmight need a third-party solution that can be easily combined with Pod Security\nAdmission.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next</h2>\n<p>For further details on the SIG Auth processes, covering PodSecurityPolicy removal and\ncreation of Pod Security admission, the\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFtHRmPuhEw\">SIG auth update at KubeCon NA 2019</a>\nand the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsRRmlTJpls\">PodSecurityPolicy Replacement: Past, Present, and Future</a>\npresentation at KubeCon NA 2021 records are available.</p>\n<p>Particularly on the PSP removal, the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/\">PodSecurityPolicy Deprecation: Past, Present, and Future</a>\nblog post is still accurate.</p>\n<p>And for the new Pod Security admission,\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/\">documentation is available</a>.\nIn addition, the blog post\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/12/09/pod-security-admission-beta/\">Kubernetes 1.23: Pod Security Graduates to Beta</a>\nalong with the KubeCon EU 2022 presentation\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcz5VsvOYmI\">The Hitchhiker's Guide to Pod Security</a>\ngive great hands-on tutorials to learn.</p>","PublishedAt":"2022-08-23 23:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/23/podsecuritypolicy-the-historical-context/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":1443,"Title":"Datadog Achieves AWS Security, Networking and Retail Competencies","Description":"NEW YORK — Datadog, Inc.
