The removal was originally\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/08/kubernetes-1-20-release-announcement/\">announced</a>\nas a part of the Kubernetes v1.20 release. The Kubernetes\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/#release-v1-24\">v1.24 release</a> actually removed the dockershim\nfrom Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>For more on what that means, check out the blog post\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/\">Don't Panic: Kubernetes and Docker</a>.</p>\n<p>To determine the impact that the removal of dockershim would have for you or your organization,\nyou can read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/check-if-dockershim-removal-affects-you/\">Check whether dockershim removal affects you</a>.</p>\n<p>In the months and days leading up to the Kubernetes 1.24 release, Kubernetes contributors worked hard to try to make this a smooth transition.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A blog post detailing our <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/01/07/kubernetes-is-moving-on-from-dockershim/\">commitment and next steps</a>.</li>\n<li>Checking if there were major blockers to migration to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#container-runtimes\">other container runtimes</a>.</li>\n<li>Adding a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/\">migrating from dockershim</a> guide.</li>\n<li>Creating a list of\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/topics-on-dockershim-and-cri-compatible-runtimes/\">articles on dockershim removal and on using CRI-compatible runtimes</a>.\nThat list includes some of the already mentioned docs, and also covers selected external sources\n(including vendor guides).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"why-was-the-dockershim-removed-from-kubernetes\">Why was the dockershim removed from Kubernetes?</h3>\n<p>Early versions of Kubernetes only worked with a specific container runtime:\nDocker Engine. Later, Kubernetes added support for working with other container runtimes.\nThe CRI standard was <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/12/container-runtime-interface-cri-in-kubernetes/\">created</a> to\nenable interoperability between orchestrators (like Kubernetes) and many different container\nruntimes.\nDocker Engine doesn't implement that interface (CRI), so the Kubernetes project created\nspecial code to help with the transition, and made that <em>dockershim</em> code part of Kubernetes\nitself.</p>\n<p>The dockershim code was always intended to be a temporary solution (hence the name: shim).\nYou can read more about the community discussion and planning in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2221-remove-dockershim\">Dockershim Removal Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal</a>.\nIn fact, maintaining dockershim had become a heavy burden on the Kubernetes maintainers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, features that were largely incompatible with the dockershim, such\nas cgroups v2 and user namespaces are being implemented in these newer CRI\nruntimes. Removing the dockershim from Kubernetes allows further development in those areas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"are-docker-and-containers-the-same-thing\">Are Docker and containers the same thing?</h3>\n<p>Docker popularized the Linux containers pattern and has been instrumental in\ndeveloping the underlying technology, however containers in Linux have existed\nfor a long time. The container ecosystem has grown to be much broader than just\nDocker. Standards like OCI and CRI have helped many tools grow and thrive in our\necosystem, some replacing aspects of Docker while others enhance existing\nfunctionality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"will-my-existing-container-images-still-work\">Will my existing container images still work?</h3>\n<p>Yes, the images produced from <code>docker build</code> will work with all CRI implementations.\nAll your existing images will still work exactly the same.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-about-private-images\">What about private images?</h4>\n<p>Yes. All CRI runtimes support the same pull secrets configuration used in\nKubernetes, either via the PodSpec or ServiceAccount.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-still-use-docker-engine-in-kubernetes-1-23\">Can I still use Docker Engine in Kubernetes 1.23?</h3>\n<p>Yes, the only thing changed in 1.20 is a single warning log printed at <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/\">kubelet</a>\nstartup if using Docker Engine as the runtime. You'll see this warning in all versions up to 1.23. The dockershim removal occurred\nin Kubernetes 1.24.</p>\n<p>If you're running Kubernetes v1.24 or later, see <a href=\"#can-i-still-use-docker-engine-as-my-container-runtime\">Can I still use Docker Engine as my container runtime?</a>.\n(Remember, you can switch away from the dockershim if you're using any supported Kubernetes release; from release v1.24, you\n<strong>must</strong> switch as Kubernetes no longer includes the dockershim).</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-cri-implementation-should-i-use\">Which CRI implementation should I use?</h3>\n<p>That’s a complex question and it depends on a lot of factors. If Docker Engine is\nworking for you, moving to containerd should be a relatively easy swap and\nwill have strictly better performance and less overhead. However, we encourage you\nto explore all the options from the <a href=\"https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=container-runtime&amp;grouping=category\">CNCF landscape</a> in case another would be an\neven better fit for your environment.</p>\n<h4 id=\"can-i-still-use-docker-engine-as-my-container-runtime\">Can I still use Docker Engine as my container runtime?</h4>\n<p>First off, if you use Docker on your own PC to develop or test containers: nothing changes.\nYou can still use Docker locally no matter what container runtime(s) you use for your\nKubernetes clusters. Containers make this kind of interoperability possible.</p>\n<p>Mirantis and Docker have <a href=\"https://www.mirantis.com/blog/mirantis-to-take-over-support-of-kubernetes-dockershim-2/\">committed</a> to maintaining a replacement adapter for\nDocker Engine, and to maintain that adapter even after the in-tree dockershim is removed\nfrom Kubernetes. The replacement adapter is named <a href=\"https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd\"><code>cri-dockerd</code></a>.</p>\n<p>You can install <code>cri-dockerd</code> and use it to connect the kubelet to Docker Engine. Read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/migrate-dockershim-dockerd/\">Migrate Docker Engine nodes from dockershim to cri-dockerd</a> to learn more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"are-there-examples-of-folks-using-other-runtimes-in-production-today\">Are there examples of folks using other runtimes in production today?</h3>\n<p>All Kubernetes project produced artifacts (Kubernetes binaries) are validated\nwith each release.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/\">kind</a> project has been using containerd for some time and has\nseen an improvement in stability for its use case. Kind and containerd are leveraged\nmultiple times every day to validate any changes to the Kubernetes codebase. Other\nrelated projects follow a similar pattern as well, demonstrating the stability and\nusability of other container runtimes. As an example, OpenShift 4.x has been\nusing the <a href=\"https://cri-o.io/\">CRI-O</a> runtime in production since June 2019.</p>\n<p>For other examples and references you can look at the adopters of containerd and\nCRI-O, two container runtimes under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (<a href=\"https://cncf.io\">CNCF</a>).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md\">containerd</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md\">CRI-O</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"people-keep-referencing-oci-what-is-that\">People keep referencing OCI, what is that?</h3>\n<p>OCI stands for the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/about/overview/\">Open Container Initiative</a>, which standardized many of the\ninterfaces between container tools and technologies. They maintain a standard\nspecification for packaging container images (OCI image-spec) and running containers\n(OCI runtime-spec). They also maintain an actual implementation of the runtime-spec\nin the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc\">runc</a>, which is the underlying default runtime for both\n<a href=\"https://containerd.io/\">containerd</a> and <a href=\"https://cri-o.io/\">CRI-O</a>. The CRI builds on these low-level specifications to\nprovide an end-to-end standard for managing containers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-look-out-for-when-changing-cri-implementations\">What should I look out for when changing CRI implementations?</h3>\n<p>While the underlying containerization code is the same between Docker and most\nCRIs (including containerd), there are a few differences around the edges. Some\ncommon things to consider when migrating are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logging configuration</li>\n<li>Runtime resource limitations</li>\n<li>Node provisioning scripts that call docker or use Docker Engine via its control socket</li>\n<li>Plugins for <code>kubectl</code> that require the <code>docker</code> CLI or the Docker Engine control socket</li>\n<li>Tools from the Kubernetes project that require direct access to Docker Engine\n(for example: the deprecated <code>kube-imagepuller</code> tool)</li>\n<li>Configuration of functionality like <code>registry-mirrors</code> and insecure registries</li>\n<li>Other support scripts or daemons that expect Docker Engine to be available and are run\noutside of Kubernetes (for example, monitoring or security agents)</li>\n<li>GPUs or special hardware and how they integrate with your runtime and Kubernetes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use Kubernetes resource requests/limits or file-based log collection\nDaemonSets then they will continue to work the same, but if you've customized\nyour <code>dockerd</code> configuration, you’ll need to adapt that for your new container\nruntime where possible.</p>\n<p>Another thing to look out for is anything expecting to run for system maintenance\nor nested inside a container when building images will no longer work. For the\nformer, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools\"><code>crictl</code></a> tool as a drop-in replacement (see\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/crictl/#mapping-from-docker-cli-to-crictl\">mapping from docker cli to crictl</a>)\nand for the latter you can use newer container build options like <a href=\"https://github.com/genuinetools/img\">img</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/buildah\">buildah</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko\">kaniko</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/buildkit-cli-for-kubectl\">buildkit-cli-for-kubectl</a> that don’t require Docker.</p>\n<p>For containerd, you can start with their <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/cri/blob/master/docs/registry.md\">documentation</a> to see what configuration\noptions are available as you migrate things over.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how to use containerd and CRI-O with Kubernetes, see the\nKubernetes documentation on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/\">Container Runtimes</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-if-i-have-more-questions\">What if I have more questions?</h3>\n<p>If you use a vendor-supported Kubernetes distribution, you can ask them about\nupgrade plans for their products.

Since its\ninauguration, the SIG Node CI subproject has run a weekly meeting, and even the full hour\nis often not enough to complete triage of all bugs, test-related PRs and issues, and discuss all\nrelated ongoing work within the subgroup.</p>\n<p>Over the past two years, we've fixed merge-blocking and release-blocking tests, reducing time to merge Kubernetes contributors' pull requests thanks to reduced test flakes. When we started, Node test jobs only passed 42% of the time, and through our efforts, we now ensure a consistent &gt;90% job pass rate. We've closed 144 test failure issues and merged 176 pull requests just in kubernetes/kubernetes. And we've helped subproject participants ascend the Kubernetes contributor ladder, with 3 new org members, 6 new reviewers, and 2 new approvers.</p>\n<p>The Node CI subproject is an approachable first stop to help new contributors\nget started with SIG Node. There is a low barrier to entry for new contributors\nto address high-impact bugs and test fixes, although there is a long\nroad before contributors can climb the entire contributor ladder:\nit took over a year to establish two new approvers for the group.\nThe complexity of all the different components that power Kubernetes nodes\nand its test infrastructure requires a sustained investment over a long period\nfor developers to deeply understand the entire system,\nboth at high and low levels of detail.</p>\n<p>We have several regular contributors at our meetings, however; our reviewers\nand approvers pool is still small. It is our goal to continue to grow\ncontributors to ensure a sustainable distribution of work\nthat does not just fall to a few key approvers.</p>\n<p>It's not always obvious how subprojects within SIGs are formed, operate,\nand work. Each is unique to its sponsoring SIG and tailored to the projects\nthat the group is intended to support. As a group that has welcomed many\nfirst-time SIG Node contributors, we'd like to share some of the details and\naccomplishments over the past two years,\nhelping to demystify our inner workings and celebrate the hard work\nof all our dedicated contributors!</p>\n<h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2>\n<p><em><strong>May 2020.</strong></em> SIG Node CI group was formed on May 11, 2020, with more than\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fb-ugvgdSVIkkuJ388_nhp2pBTy_4HEVg5848Xy7n5U/edit#bookmark=id.vsb8pqnf4gib\">30 volunteers</a>\nsigned up, to improve SIG Node CI signal and overall observability.\nVictor Pickard focused on getting\n<a href=\"https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-node\">testgrid jobs</a> passing\nwhen Ning Liao suggested forming a group around this effort and came up with\nthe <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yS-XoUl6GjZdjrwxInEZVHhxxLXlTIX2CeWOARmD8tY/edit#heading=h.te6sgum6s8uf\">original group charter document</a>.\nThe SIG Node chairs sponsored group creation with Victor as a subproject lead.\nSergey Kanzhelev joined Victor shortly after as a co-lead.</p>\n<p>At the kick-off meeting, we discussed which tests to concentrate on fixing first\nand discussed merge-blocking and release-blocking tests, many of which were failing due\nto infrastructure issues or buggy test code.</p>\n<p>The subproject launched weekly hour-long meetings to discuss ongoing work\ndiscussion and triage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>June 2020.</strong></em> Morgan Bauer, Karan Goel, and Jorge Alarcon Ochoa were\nrecognized as reviewers for the SIG Node CI group for their contributions,\nhelping significantly with the early stages of the subproject.\nDavid Porter and Roy Yang also joined the SIG test failures GitHub team.</p>\n<p><em><strong>August 2020.</strong></em> All merge-blocking and release-blocking tests were passing,\nwith some flakes. However, only 42% of all SIG Node test jobs were green, as there\nwere many flakes and failing tests.</p>\n<p><em><strong>October 2020.</strong></em> Amim Knabben becomes a Kubernetes org member for his\ncontributions to the subproject.</p>\n<p><em><strong>January 2021.</strong></em> With healthy presubmit and critical periodic jobs passing,\nthe subproject discussed its goal for cleaning up the rest of periodic tests\nand ensuring they passed without flakes.</p>\n<p>Elana Hashman joined the subproject, stepping up to help lead it after\nVictor's departure.</p>\n<p><em><strong>February 2021.</strong></em> Artyom Lukianov becomes a Kubernetes org member for his\ncontributions to the subproject.</p>\n<p><em><strong>August 2021.</strong></em> After SIG Node successfully ran a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/w2ghO4ihje0/m/VeEql1LJBAAJ\">bug scrub</a>\nto clean up its bug backlog, the scope of the meeting was extended to\ninclude bug triage to increase overall reliability, anticipating issues\nbefore they affect the CI signal.</p>\n<p>Subproject leads Elana Hashman and Sergey Kanzhelev are both recognized as\napprovers on all node test code, supported by SIG Node and SIG Testing.</p>\n<p><em><strong>September 2021.</strong></em> After significant deflaking progress with serial tests in\nthe 1.22 release spearheaded by Francesco Romani, the subproject set a goal\nfor getting the serial job fully passing by the 1.23 release date.</p>\n<p>Mike Miranda becomes a Kubernetes org member for his contributions\nto the subproject.</p>\n<p><em><strong>November 2021.</strong></em> Throughout 2021, SIG Node had no merge or\nrelease-blocking test failures. Many flaky tests from past releases are removed\nfrom release-blocking dashboards as they had been fully cleaned up.</p>\n<p>Danielle Lancashire was recognized as a reviewer for SIG Node's subgroup, test code.</p>\n<p>The final node serial tests were completely fixed. The serial tests consist of\nmany disruptive and slow tests which tend to be flakey and are hard\nto troubleshoot. By the 1.23 release freeze, the last serial tests were\nfixed and the job was passing without flakes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0BP8PW9G/p1638211041322900\"><img src=\"serial-tests-green.png\" alt=\"Slack announcement that Serial tests are green\"></a></p>\n<p>The 1.23 release got a special shout out for the tests quality and CI signal.\nThe SIG Node CI subproject was proud to have helped contribute to such\na high-quality release, in part due to our efforts in identifying\nand fixing flakes in Node and beyond.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C92G08FGD/p1637175755023200\"><img src=\"release-mostly-green.png\" alt=\"Slack shoutout that release was mostly green\"></a></p>\n<p><em><strong>December 2021.</strong></em> An estimated 90% of test jobs were passing at the time of\nthe 1.23 release (up from 42% in August 2020).</p>\n<p>Dockershim code was removed from Kubernetes. This affected nearly half of SIG Node's\ntest jobs and the SIG Node CI subproject reacted quickly and retargeted all the\ntests. SIG Node was the first SIG to complete test migrations off dockershim,\nproviding examples for other affected SIGs. The vast majority of new jobs passed\nat the time of introduction without further fixes required. The <a href=\"https://k8s.io/dockershim\">effort of\nremoving dockershim</a>) from Kubernetes is ongoing.\nThere are still some wrinkles from the dockershim removal as we uncover more\ndependencies on dockershim, but we plan to stabilize all test jobs\nby the 1.24 release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"statistics\">Statistics</h2>\n<p>Our regular meeting attendees and subproject participants for the past few months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aditi Sharma</li>\n<li>Artyom Lukianov</li>\n<li>Arnaud Meukam</li>\n<li>Danielle Lancashire</li>\n<li>David Porter</li>\n<li>Davanum Srinivas</li>\n<li>Elana Hashman</li>\n<li>Francesco Romani</li>\n<li>Matthias Bertschy</li>\n<li>Mike Miranda</li>\n<li>Paco Xu</li>\n<li>Peter Hunt</li>\n<li>Ruiwen Zhao</li>\n<li>Ryan Phillips</li>\n<li>Sergey Kanzhelev</li>\n<li>Skyler Clark</li>\n<li>Swati Sehgal</li>\n<li>Wenjun Wu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/\">kubernetes/test-infra</a> source code repository contains test definitions.
