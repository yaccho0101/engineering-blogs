As organizations increasingly opt to run these systems in the cloud, their cloud spend tends not only to grow but also to become more opaque due to the dynamic complexity of these environments. Typically, various services, teams, and products share cluster resources, and as nodes are added and removed, those resources continuously shift.","PublishedAt":"2023-06-07 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/cloud-cost-management-container-support/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":3866,"Title":"High risk but low funding: How UK universities can do cybersecurity on a budget","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-06-07 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/uk-universities-cybersecurity-on-a-budget","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3869,"Title":"React quickly to cost overruns with Cost Monitors for Datadog Cloud Cost Management","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/ccm-cost-monitors/ccm_tag_governance_feature_announcement_230606_FINAL.png\" width=\"100%\"/>The dynamic nature of cloud costs can make it difficult to fully understand your cloud spend and embrace cost ownership at all levels of your organization. To establish cost governance, FinOps teams need a complete view of cloud costs, including allocation by team, service, and product.
