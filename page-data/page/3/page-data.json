(quick refresher)</h2>\n<p>kubeadm is focused on bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters on existing infrastructure and performing an essential set of maintenance tasks. The core of the kubeadm interface is quite simple: new control plane nodes\nare created by running <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-init/\"><code>kubeadm init</code></a> and\nworker nodes are joined to the control plane by running\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-join/\"><code>kubeadm join</code></a>.\nAlso included are utilities for managing already bootstrapped clusters, such as control plane upgrades\nand token and certificate renewal.</p>\n<p>To keep kubeadm lean, focused, and vendor/infrastructure agnostic, the following tasks are out of its scope:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infrastructure provisioning</li>\n<li>Third-party networking</li>\n<li>Non-critical add-ons, e.g. for monitoring, logging, and visualization</li>\n<li>Specific cloud provider integrations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Infrastructure provisioning, for example, is left to other SIG Cluster Lifecycle projects, such as the\n<a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Cluster API</a>. Instead, kubeadm covers only the common denominator\nin every Kubernetes cluster: the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components\">control plane</a>.\nThe user may install their preferred networking solution and other add-ons on top of Kubernetes\n<em>after</em> cluster creation.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, kubeadm does a lot. The tool makes sure you have all the key components:\netcd, the API server, the scheduler, the controller manager. You can join more control plane nodes\nfor improving resiliency or join worker nodes for running your workloads. You get cluster DNS\nand kube-proxy set up for you. TLS between components is enabled and used for encryption in transit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"let-s-celebrate-past-present-and-future-of-kubeadm\">Let's celebrate! Past, present and future of kubeadm</h2>\n<p>In all and for all kubeadm's story is tightly coupled with Kubernetes' story, and with this amazing community.</p>\n<p>Therefore celebrating kubeadm is first of all celebrating this community, a set of people, who joined forces in finding a common ground, a minimum viable tool, for bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters.</p>\n<p>This tool, was instrumental to the Kubernetes success back in time as well as it is today, and the silver line of kubeadm's value proposition can be summarized in two points</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An obsession in making things deadly simple for the majority of the users: kubeadm init &amp; kubeadm join, that's all you need!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A sharp focus on a well-defined problem scope: bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters on existing infrastructure. As our slogan says: <em>keep it simple, keep it extensible!</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This silver line, this clear contract, is the foundation the entire kubeadm user base relies on, and this post is a celebration for kubeadm's users as well.</p>\n<p>We are deeply thankful for any feedback from our users, for the enthusiasm that they are continuously showing for this tool via Slack, GitHub, social media, blogs, in person at every KubeCon or at the various meet ups around the world. Keep going!</p>\n<p>What continues to amaze me after all those years is the great things people are building on top of kubeadm, and as of today there is a strong and very active list of projects doing so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/\">minikube</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/\">kind</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Cluster API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kubespray.io/\">Kubespray</a></li>\n<li>and many more; if you are using Kubernetes today, there is a good chance that you are using kubeadm even without knowing it üòú</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This community, the kubeadm‚Äôs users, the projects building on top of kubeadm are the highlights of kubeadm‚Äôs 7th birthday celebration and the foundation for what will come next!</p>\n<p>Stay tuned, and feel free to reach out to us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/\">kubeadm</a> to install Kubernetes today</li>\n<li>Get involved with the Kubernetes project on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\">GitHub</a></li>\n<li>Connect with the community on <a href=\"http://slack.k8s.io/\">Slack</a></li>\n<li>Follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kubernetesio\">@Kubernetesio</a> for latest updates</li>\n</ul>","PublishedAt":"2023-09-26 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/09/26/happy-7th-birthday-kubeadm/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":4659,"Title":"Introducing Filestream fingerprint mode","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-09-26 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-filestream-fingerprint-mode","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4660,"Title":"Unlocking whole-system visibility with Elastic Universal Profiling‚Ñ¢","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-09-26 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whole-system-visibility-elastic-universal-profiling","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4667,"Title":"Deconstructing Type Parameters","Description":"Why the function signatures in the slices packages are so complicated.","PublishedAt":"2023-09-26 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://go.dev/blog/deconstructing-type-parameters","SourceName":"The Go Blog"}},{"node":{"ID":4651,"Title":"AWS Weekly Roundup: Amazon EC2 M2 Pro Mac, Amazon Coretto 21, Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics, and more (Sept. 25, 2023)","Description":"This week, I‚Äôm in Jakarta to support AWS User Group Indonesia and AWS Cloud Day Indonesia.

By default, kubeadm runs\na local etcd instance on each control plane node.</p>\n<p>In v1.27, kubeadm introduced a new feature gate <code>EtcdLearnerMode</code>. With this feature gate enabled,\nwhen joining a new control plane node, a new etcd member will be created as a learner and\npromoted to a voting member only after the etcd data are fully aligned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-advantages-of-using-etcd-learner-mode\">What are the advantages of using etcd learner mode?</h2>\n<p>etcd learner mode offers several compelling reasons to consider its adoption\nin Kubernetes clusters:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Resilience</strong>: etcd learner nodes are non-voting members that catch up with\nthe leader's logs before becoming fully operational. This prevents new cluster members\nfrom disrupting the quorum or causing leader elections, making the cluster more resilient\nduring membership changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Cluster Unavailability</strong>: Traditional approaches to adding new members often\nresult in cluster unavailability periods, especially in slow infrastructure or misconfigurations.\netcd learner mode minimizes such disruptions.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplified Maintenance</strong>: Learner nodes provide a safer and reversible way to add or replace\ncluster members. This reduces the risk of accidental cluster outages due to misconfigurations or\nmissteps during member additions.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Network Tolerance</strong>: In scenarios involving network partitions, learner mode allows\nfor more graceful handling. Depending on the partition a new member lands, it can seamlessly\nintegrate with the existing cluster without causing disruptions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the etcd learner mode improves the reliability and manageability of Kubernetes clusters\nduring member additions and changes, making it a valuable feature for cluster operators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-nodes-join-a-cluster-that-s-using-the-new-mode\">How nodes join a cluster that's using the new mode</h2>\n<h3 id=\"create-K8s-cluster-etcd-learner-mode\">Create a Kubernetes cluster backed by etcd in learner mode</h3>\n<p>For a general explanation about creating highly available clusters with kubeadm, you can refer to\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/\">Creating Highly Available Clusters with kubeadm</a>.</p>\n<p>To create a Kubernetes cluster, backed by etcd in learner mode, using kubeadm, follow these steps:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#080;font-style:italic\"># kubeadm init --feature-gates=EtcdLearnerMode=true ...</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>kubeadm init --config<span style=\"color:#666\">=</span>kubeadm-config.yaml\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The kubeadm configuration file is like below:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>ClusterConfiguration<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">featureGates</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">EtcdLearnerMode</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#a2f;font-weight:bold\">true</span><span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The kubeadm tool deploys a single-node Kubernetes cluster with etcd set to use learner mode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"join-nodes-to-the-kubernetes-cluster\">Join nodes to the Kubernetes cluster</h3>\n<p>Before joining a control-plane node to the new Kubernetes cluster, ensure that the existing control plane nodes\nand all etcd members are healthy.</p>\n<p>Check the cluster health with <code>etcdctl</code>.
