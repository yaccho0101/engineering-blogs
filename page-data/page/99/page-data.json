CSI migration was introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.14.\nSince then, SIG Storage and other Kubernetes special interest groups are working to ensure feature stability and compatibility in preparation for CSI Migration feature to go GA.</p>\n<p>SIG Storage is excited to announce that the core CSI Migration feature is <strong>generally available</strong> in Kubernetes v1.25 release!</p>\n<p>SIG Storage wrote a blog post in v1.23 for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/12/10/storage-in-tree-to-csi-migration-status-update/\">CSI Migration status update</a> which discussed the CSI migration status for each storage driver. It has been a while and this article is intended to give a latest status update on each storage driver for their CSI Migration status in Kubernetes v1.25.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quick-recap-what-is-csi-migration-and-why-migrate\">Quick recap: What is CSI Migration, and why migrate?</h2>\n<p>The Container Storage Interface (CSI) was designed to help Kubernetes replace its existing, in-tree storage driver mechanisms - especially vendor specific plugins.\nKubernetes support for the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#README\">Container Storage Interface</a> has been\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/\">generally available</a> since Kubernetes v1.13.\nSupport for using CSI drivers was introduced to make it easier to add and maintain new integrations between Kubernetes and storage backend technologies. Using CSI drivers allows for better maintainability (driver authors can define their own release cycle and support lifecycle) and reduce the opportunity for vulnerabilities (with less in-tree code, the risks of a mistake are reduced, and cluster operators can select only the storage drivers that their cluster requires).</p>\n<p>As more CSI Drivers were created and became production ready, SIG Storage wanted all Kubernetes users to benefit from the CSI model. However, we could not break API compatibility with the existing storage API types due to k8s architecture conventions. The solution we came up with was CSI migration: a feature that translates in-tree APIs to equivalent CSI APIs and delegates operations to a replacement CSI driver.</p>\n<p>The CSI migration effort enables the replacement of existing in-tree storage plugins such as <code>kubernetes.io/gce-pd</code> or <code>kubernetes.io/aws-ebs</code> with a corresponding <a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/introduction.html\">CSI driver</a> from the storage backend.\nIf CSI Migration is working properly, Kubernetes end users shouldn’t notice a difference. Existing <code>StorageClass</code>, <code>PersistentVolume</code> and <code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code> objects should continue to work.\nWhen a Kubernetes cluster administrator updates a cluster to enable CSI migration, existing workloads that utilize PVCs which are backed by in-tree storage plugins will continue to function as they always have.\nHowever, behind the scenes, Kubernetes hands control of all storage management operations (previously targeting in-tree drivers) to CSI drivers.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose you are a <code>kubernetes.io/gce-pd</code> user; after CSI migration, you can still use <code>kubernetes.io/gce-pd</code> to provision new volumes, mount existing GCE-PD volumes or delete existing volumes. All existing APIs and Interface will still function correctly. However, the underlying function calls are all going through the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gcp-compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver\">GCE PD CSI driver</a> instead of the in-tree Kubernetes function.</p>\n<p>This enables a smooth transition for end users. Additionally as storage plugin developers, we can reduce the burden of maintaining the in-tree storage plugins and eventually remove them from the core Kubernetes binary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"timeline-and-status\">What is the timeline / status?</h2>\n<p>The current and targeted releases for each individual driver is shown in the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Driver</th>\n<th>Alpha</th>\n<th>Beta (in-tree deprecated)</th>\n<th>Beta (on-by-default)</th>\n<th>GA</th>\n<th>Target &quot;in-tree plugin&quot; removal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>AWS EBS</td>\n<td>1.14</td>\n<td>1.17</td>\n<td>1.23</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>1.27 (Target)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Azure Disk</td>\n<td>1.15</td>\n<td>1.19</td>\n<td>1.23</td>\n<td>1.24</td>\n<td>1.26 (Target)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Azure File</td>\n<td>1.15</td>\n<td>1.21</td>\n<td>1.24</td>\n<td>1.26 (Target)</td>\n<td>1.28 (Target)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ceph FS</td>\n<td>1.26 (Target)</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ceph RBD</td>\n<td>1.23</td>\n<td>1.26 (Target)</td>\n<td>1.27 (Target)</td>\n<td>1.28 (Target)</td>\n<td>1.30 (Target)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GCE PD</td>\n<td>1.14</td>\n<td>1.17</td>\n<td>1.23</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>1.27 (Target)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OpenStack Cinder</td>\n<td>1.14</td>\n<td>1.18</td>\n<td>1.21</td>\n<td>1.24</td>\n<td>1.26 (Target)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Portworx</td>\n<td>1.23</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>1.26 (Target)</td>\n<td>1.27 (Target)</td>\n<td>1.29 (Target)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>vSphere</td>\n<td>1.18</td>\n<td>1.19</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>1.26 (Target)</td>\n<td>1.28 (Target)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The following storage drivers will not have CSI migration support.\nThe <code>scaleio</code>, <code>flocker</code>, <code>quobyte</code> and <code>storageos</code> drivers were removed; the others are deprecated and will be removed from core Kubernetes in the coming releases.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Driver</th>\n<th>Deprecated</th>\n<th>Code Removal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Flocker</td>\n<td>1.22</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GlusterFS</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>1.26 (Target)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Quobyte</td>\n<td>1.22</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ScaleIO</td>\n<td>1.16</td>\n<td>1.22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>StorageOS</td>\n<td>1.22</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-for-the-core-csi-migration-feature-to-go-ga\">What does it mean for the core CSI Migration feature to go GA?</h2>\n<p>Core CSI Migration goes to GA means that the general framework, core library and API for CSI migration is\nstable for Kubernetes v1.25 and will be part of future Kubernetes releases as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are a Kubernetes distribution maintainer, this means if you disabled <code>CSIMigration</code> feature gate previously, you are no longer allowed to do so because the feature gate has been locked.</li>\n<li>If you are a Kubernetes storage driver developer, this means you can expect no backwards incompatibility changes in the CSI migration library.</li>\n<li>If you are a Kubernetes maintainer, expect nothing changes from your day to day development flows.</li>\n<li>If you are a Kubernetes user, expect nothing to change from your day-to-day usage flows.

They are sufficiently expressive to replace the vast majority of CRD validation checks currently implemented in admission webhooks. This results in CRDs that are self-contained and are easier to understand.</li>\n<li>CEL expressions are compiled and type checked against a CRD's schema &quot;ahead-of-time&quot; (when CRDs are created and updated) allowing them to be evaluated efficiently and safely &quot;runtime&quot; (when custom resources are validated). Even regex string literals in CEL are validated and pre-compiled when CRDs are created or updated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-use-validation-webhooks\">Why not use validation webhooks?</h2>\n<p>Benefits of using validation rules when compared with validation webhooks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CRD authors benefit from a simpler workflow since validation rules eliminate the need to develop and maintain a webhook.</li>\n<li>Cluster administrators benefit by no longer having to install, upgrade and operate webhooks for the purposes of CRD validation.</li>\n<li>Cluster operability improves because CRD validation no longer requires a remote call to a webhook endpoint, eliminating a potential point of failure in the request-serving-path of the Kubernetes API server. This allows clusters to retain high availability while scaling to larger amounts of installed CRD extensions, since expected control plane availability would otherwise decrease with each additional webhook installed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started-with-validation-rules\">Getting started with validation rules</h2>\n<h3 id=\"writing-validation-rules-in-openapiv3-schemas\">Writing validation rules in OpenAPIv3 schemas</h3>\n<p>You can define validation rules for any level of a CRD's OpenAPIv3 schema. Validation rules are automatically scoped to their location in the schema where they are declared.</p>\n<p>Good practices for CRD validation rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scope validation rules as close as possible to the fields(s) they validate.</li>\n<li>Use multiple rules when validating independent constraints.</li>\n<li>Do not use validation rules for validations already</li>\n<li>Use OpenAPIv3 <a href=\"https://swagger.io/specification/#properties\">value validations</a> (<code>maxLength</code>, <code>maxItems</code>, <code>maxProperties</code>, <code>required</code>, <code>enum</code>, <code>minimum</code>, <code>maximum</code>, ..) and <a href=\"https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#format\">string formats</a> where available.</li>\n<li>Use <code>x-kubernetes-int-or-string</code>, <code>x-kubernetes-embedded-type</code> and <code>x-kubernetes-list-type=(set|map)</code> were appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Examples of good practice:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation</th>\n<th>Best Practice</th>\n<th>Example(s)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Validate an integer is between 0 and 100.</td>\n<td>Use OpenAPIv3 value validations.</td>\n<td><pre>type: integer<br>minimum: 0<br>maximum: 100</pre></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Constraint the max size limits on maps (objects with additionalProperties), arrays and string.</td>\n<td>Use OpenAPIv3 value validations. Recommended for all maps, arrays and strings. This best practice is essential for rule cost estimation (explained below).</td>\n<td><pre>type:<br>maxItems: 100</pre></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Require a date-time be more recent than a particular timestamp.</td>\n<td>Use OpenAPIv3 string formats to declare that the field is a date-time. Use validation rules to compare it to a particular timestamp.</td>\n<td><pre>type: string<br>format: date-time<br>x-kubernetes-validations:<br> - rule: &quot;self &gt;= timestamp('2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z')&quot;</pre></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Require two sets to be disjoint.</td>\n<td>Use x-kubernetes-list-type to validate that the arrays are sets. <br>Use validation rules to validate the sets are disjoint.</td>\n<td><pre>type: object<br>properties:<br> set1:<br> type: array<br> x-kubernetes-list-type: set<br> set2: ...<br> x-kubernetes-validations:<br> - rule: &quot;!self.set1.all(e, !(e in self.set2))&quot;</pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"crd-transition-rules\">CRD transition rules</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#transition-rules\">Transition Rules</a> make it possible to compare the new state against the old state of a resource in validation rules. You use transition rules to make sure that the cluster's API server does not accept invalid state transitions. A transition rule is a validation rule that references 'oldSelf'. The API server only evaluates transition rules when both an old value and new value exist.</p>\n<p>Transition rule examples:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Transition Rule</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>self == oldSelf</code></td>\n<td>For a required field, make that field immutable once it is set. For an optional field, only allow transitioning from unset to set, or from set to unset.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>(on parent of field) <code>has(self.field) == has(oldSelf.field)</code><br>on field: <code>self == oldSelf</code></td>\n<td>Make a field immutable: validate that a field, even if optional, never changes after the resource is created (for a required field, the previous rule is simpler).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>self.all(x, x in oldSelf)</code></td>\n<td>Only allow adding items to a field that represents a set (prevent removals).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>self &gt;= oldSelf</code></td>\n<td>Validate that a number is monotonically increasing.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"using-the-functions-libraries\">Using the Functions Libraries</h2>\n<p>Validation rules have access to a couple different function libraries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CEL standard functions, defined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/v0.7.0/doc/langdef.md#list-of-standard-definitions\">list of standard definitions</a></li>\n<li>CEL standard <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/v0.7.0/doc/langdef.md#macros\">macros</a></li>\n<li>CEL <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/ext#Strings\">extended string function library</a></li>\n<li>Kubernetes <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/schema/cel/library#pkg-functions\">CEL extension library</a> which includes supplemental functions for <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/schema/cel/library#pkg-functions\">lists</a>, <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/schema/cel/library#Regex\">regex</a>, and <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/schema/cel/library#Regex\">URLs</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Examples of function libraries in use:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Rule</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>!(self.getDayOfWeek() in [0, 6])</code></td>\n<td>Validate that a date is not a Sunday or Saturday.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>isUrl(self) &amp;&amp; url(self).getHostname() in [a.example.com', 'b.example.com']</code></td>\n<td>Validate that a URL has an allowed hostname.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>self.map(x, x.weight).sum() == 1</code></td>\n<td>Validate that the weights of a list of objects sum to 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>int(self.find('^[0-9]*')) &lt; 100</code></td>\n<td>Validate that a string starts with a number less than 100.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>self.isSorted()</code></td>\n<td>Validates that a list is sorted.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"resource-use-and-limits\">Resource use and limits</h2>\n<p>To prevent CEL evaluation from consuming excessive compute resources, validation rules impose some limits. These limits are based on CEL <em>cost units</em>, a platform and machine independent measure of execution cost. As a result, the limits are the same regardless of where they are enforced.</p>\n<h3 id=\"estimated-cost-limit\">Estimated cost limit</h3>\n<p>CEL is, by design, non-Turing-complete in such a way that the halting problem isn’t a concern. CEL takes advantage of this design choice to include an &quot;estimated cost&quot; subsystem that can statically compute the worst case run time cost of any CEL expression. Validation rules are <a href=\"o/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#resource-use-by-validation-functions\">integrated with the estimated cost system</a> and disallow CEL expressions from being included in CRDs if they have a sufficiently poor (high) estimated cost. The estimated cost limit is set quite high and typically requires an O(n^2) or worse operation, across something of unbounded size, to be exceeded. Fortunately the fix is usually quite simple: because the cost system is aware of size limits declared in the CRD's schema, CRD authors can add size limits to the CRD's schema (<code>maxItems</code> for arrays, <code>maxProperties</code> for maps, <code>maxLength</code> for strings) to reduce the estimated cost.</p>\n<p>Good practice:</p>\n<p>Set <code>maxItems</code>, <code>maxProperties</code> and <code>maxLength</code> on all array, map (<code>object</code> with <code>additionalProperties</code>) and string types in CRD schemas! This results in lower and more accurate estimated costs and generally makes a CRD safer to use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"runtime-cost-limits-for-crd-validation-rules\">Runtime cost limits for CRD validation rules</h3>\n<p>In addition to the estimated cost limit, CEL keeps track of actual cost while evaluating a CEL expression and will halt execution of the expression if a limit is exceeded.</p>\n<p>With the estimated cost limit already in place, the runtime cost limit is rarely encountered. But it is possible. For example, it might be encountered for a large resource composed entirely of a single large list and a validation rule that is either evaluated on each element in the list, or traverses the entire list.</p>\n<p>CRD authors can ensure the runtime cost limit will not be exceeded in much the same way the estimated cost limit is avoided: by setting <code>maxItems</code>, <code>maxProperties</code> and <code>maxLength</code> on array, map and string types.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-work\">Future work</h2>\n<p>We look forward to working with the community on the adoption of CRD Validation Rules, and hope to see this feature promoted to general availability in an upcoming Kubernetes release!</p>\n<p>There is a growing community of Kubernetes contributors thinking about how to make it possible to write extensible admission controllers using CEL as a substitute for admission webhooks for policy enforcement use cases.
