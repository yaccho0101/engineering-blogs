This has been a disruptive operation for running\nworkloads... until now.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.27, we have added a new alpha feature that allows users\nto resize CPU/memory resources allocated to pods without restarting the\ncontainers. To facilitate this, the <code>resources</code> field in a pod's containers\nnow allow mutation for <code>cpu</code> and <code>memory</code> resources. They can be changed\nsimply by patching the running pod spec.</p>\n<p>This also means that <code>resources</code> field in the pod spec can no longer be\nrelied upon as an indicator of the pod's actual resources. Monitoring tools\nand other such applications must now look at new fields in the pod's status.\nKubernetes queries the actual CPU and memory requests and limits enforced on\nthe running containers via a CRI (Container Runtime Interface) API call to the\nruntime, such as containerd, which is responsible for running the containers.\nThe response from container runtime is reflected in the pod's status.</p>\n<p>In addition, a new <code>restartPolicy</code> for resize has been added. It gives users\ncontrol over how their containers are handled when resources are resized.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-v1-27\">What's new in v1.27?</h2>\n<p>Besides the addition of resize policy in the pod's spec, a new field named\n<code>allocatedResources</code> has been added to <code>containerStatuses</code> in the pod's status.\nThis field reflects the node resources allocated to the pod's containers.</p>\n<p>In addition, a new field called <code>resources</code> has been added to the container's\nstatus. This field reflects the actual resource requests and limits configured\non the running containers as reported by the container runtime.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a new field named <code>resize</code> has been added to the pod's status to show the\nstatus of the last requested resize. A value of <code>Proposed</code> is an acknowledgement\nof the requested resize and indicates that request was validated and recorded. A\nvalue of <code>InProgress</code> indicates that the node has accepted the resize request\nand is in the process of applying the resize request to the pod's containers.\nA value of <code>Deferred</code> means that the requested resize cannot be granted at this\ntime, and the node will keep retrying. The resize may be granted when other pods\nleave and free up node resources. A value of <code>Infeasible</code> is a signal that the\nnode cannot accommodate the requested resize. This can happen if the requested\nresize exceeds the maximum resources the node can ever allocate for a pod.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-this-feature\">When to use this feature</h2>\n<p>Here are a few examples where this feature may be useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pod is running on node but with either too much or too little resources.</li>\n<li>Pods are not being scheduled do to lack of sufficient CPU or memory in a\ncluster that is underutilized by running pods that were overprovisioned.</li>\n<li>Evicting certain stateful pods that need more resources to schedule them\non bigger nodes is an expensive or disruptive operation when other lower\npriority pods in the node can be resized down or moved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-this-feature\">How to use this feature</h2>\n<p>In order to use this feature in v1.27, the <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code>\nfeature gate must be enabled. A local cluster with this feature enabled\ncan be started as shown below:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>root@vbuild:~/go/src/k8s.io/kubernetes# FEATURE_GATES=InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true ./hack/local-up-cluster.sh\ngo version go1.20.2 linux/arm64\n+++ [0320 13:52:02] Building go targets for linux/arm64\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubectl (static)\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kube-apiserver (static)\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kube-controller-manager (static)\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/cloud-controller-manager (non-static)\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubelet (non-static)\n...\n...\nLogs:\n/tmp/etcd.log\n/tmp/kube-apiserver.log\n/tmp/kube-controller-manager.log\n/tmp/kube-proxy.log\n/tmp/kube-scheduler.log\n/tmp/kubelet.log\nTo start using your cluster, you can open up another terminal/tab and run:\nexport KUBECONFIG=/var/run/kubernetes/admin.kubeconfig\ncluster/kubectl.sh\nAlternatively, you can write to the default kubeconfig:\nexport KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=local\ncluster/kubectl.sh config set-cluster local --server=https://localhost:6443 --certificate-authority=/var/run/kubernetes/server-ca.crt\ncluster/kubectl.sh config set-credentials myself --client-key=/var/run/kubernetes/client-admin.key --client-certificate=/var/run/kubernetes/client-admin.crt\ncluster/kubectl.sh config set-context local --cluster=local --user=myself\ncluster/kubectl.sh config use-context local\ncluster/kubectl.sh\n</code></pre><p>Once the local cluster is up and running, Kubernetes users can schedule pods\nwith resources, and resize the pods via kubectl. An example of how to use this\nfeature is illustrated in the following demo video.</p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1m2FOuB6Bh0\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"In-place resize of pod CPU and memory resources\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"example-use-cases\">Example Use Cases</h2>\n<h3 id=\"cloud-based-development-environment\">Cloud-based Development Environment</h3>\n<p>In this scenario, developers or development teams write their code locally\nbut build and test their code in Kubernetes pods with consistent configs\nthat reflect production use. Such pods need minimal resources when the\ndevelopers are writing code, but need significantly more CPU and memory\nwhen they build their code or run a battery of tests. This use case can\nleverage in-place pod resize feature (with a little help from eBPF) to\nquickly resize the pod's resources and avoid kernel OOM (out of memory)\nkiller from terminating their processes.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjfa1cVJLwc\">KubeCon North America 2022 conference talk</a>\nillustrates the use case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"java-processes-initialization-cpu-requirements\">Java processes initialization CPU requirements</h3>\n<p>Some Java applications may need significantly more CPU during initialization\nthan what is needed during normal process operation time. If such applications\nspecify CPU requests and limits suited for normal operation, they may suffer\nfrom very long startup times. Such pods can request higher CPU values at the\ntime of pod creation, and can be resized down to normal running needs once the\napplication has finished initializing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"known-issues\">Known Issues</h2>\n<p>This feature enters v1.27 at <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages\">alpha stage</a>.\nBelow are a few known issues users may encounter:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>containerd versions below v1.6.9 do not have the CRI support needed for full\nend-to-end operation of this feature. Attempts to resize pods will appear\nto be <em>stuck</em> in the <code>InProgress</code> state, and <code>resources</code> field in the pod's\nstatus are never updated even though the new resources may have been enacted\non the running containers.</li>\n<li>Pod resize may encounter a race condition with other pod updates, causing\ndelayed enactment of pod resize.</li>\n<li>Reflecting the resized container resources in pod's status may take a while.</li>\n<li>Static CPU management policy is not supported with this feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"credits\">Credits</h2>\n<p>This feature is a

Clients can use the virtual IP address (or <em>VIP</em>) provided\nby the Service for access, and Kubernetes provides load balancing for traffic accessing\ndifferent back-end Pods, but a ClusterIP type of Service is limited to providing access to\nnodes within the cluster, while traffic from outside the cluster cannot be routed.\nOne way to solve this problem is to use a <code>type: NodePort</code> Service, which sets up a mapping\nto a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, thus redirecting traffic from the\noutside to the inside of the cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-kubernetes-allocates-node-ports-to-services\">How Kubernetes allocates node ports to Services?</h2>\n<p>When a <code>type: NodePort</code> Service is created, its corresponding port(s) are allocated in one\nof two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dynamic</strong> : If the Service type is <code>NodePort</code> and you do not set a <code>nodePort</code>\nvalue explicitly in the <code>spec</code> for that Service, the Kubernetes control plane will\nautomatically allocate an unused port to it at creation time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Static</strong> : In addition to the dynamic auto-assignment described above, you can also\nexplicitly assign a port that is within the nodeport port range configuration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The value of <code>nodePort</code> that you manually assign must be unique across the whole cluster.\nAttempting to create a Service of <code>type: NodePort</code> where you explicitly specify a node port that\nwas already allocated results in an error.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-you-need-to-reserve-ports-of-nodeport-service\">Why do you need to reserve ports of NodePort Service?</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, you may want to have a NodePort Service running on well-known ports\nso that other components and users inside o r outside the cluster can use them.</p>\n<p>In some complex cluster deployments with a mix of Kubernetes nodes and other servers on the same network,\nit may be necessary to use some pre-defined ports for communication. In particular, some fundamental\ncomponents cannot rely on the VIPs that back <code>type: LoadBalancer</code> Services\nbecause the virtual IP address mapping implementation for that cluster also relies on\nthese foundational components.</p>\n<p>Now suppose you need to expose a Minio object storage service on Kubernetes to clients\nrunning outside the Kubernetes cluster, and the agreed port is <code>30009</code>, we need to\ncreate a Service as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>v1<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>Service<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">name</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>minio<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">ports</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>- <span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">name</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>api<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">nodePort</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#666\">30009</span><span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">port</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#666\">9000</span><span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">protocol</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>TCP<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">targetPort</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#666\">9000</span><span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">selector</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">app</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>minio<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">type</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>NodePort<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, as mentioned before, if the port (30009) required for the <code>minio</code> Service is not reserved,\nand another <code>type: NodePort</code> (or possibly <code>type: LoadBalancer</code>) Service is created and dynamically\nallocated before or concurrently with the <code>minio</code> Service, TCP port 30009 might be allocated to that\nother Service; if so, creation of the <code>minio</code> Service will fail due to a node port collision.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-you-avoid-nodeport-service-port-conflicts\">How can you avoid NodePort Service port conflicts?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes 1.24 introduced changes for <code>type: ClusterIP</code> Services, dividing the CIDR range for cluster\nIP addresses into two blocks that use different allocation policies to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#avoiding-collisions\">reduce the risk of conflicts</a>.\nIn Kubernetes 1.27, as an alpha feature, you can adopt a similar policy for <code>type: NodePort</code> Services.\nYou can enable a new <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a>\n<code>ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange</code>. Turning this on allows you to use a different port allocation strategy\nfor <code>type: NodePort</code> Services, and reduce the risk of collision.</p>\n<p>The port range for <code>NodePort</code> will be divided, based on the formula <code>min(max(16, nodeport-size / 32), 128)</code>.\nThe outcome of the formula will be a number between 16 and 128, with a step size that increases as the\nsize of the nodeport range increases. The outcome of the formula determine that the size of static port\nrange. When the port range is less than 16, the size of static port range will be set to 0,\nwhich means that all ports will be dynamically allocated.</p>\n<p>Dynamic port assignment will use the upper band by default, once this has been exhausted it will use the lower range.\nThis will allow users to use static allocations on the lower band with a low risk of collision.</p>\n<h2
