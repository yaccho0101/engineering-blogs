Automating\nthe migration from the legacy to the community-owned repositories is technically\nchallenging and we want to avoid any potential risks associated with this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p>First of all, we want to acknowledge the contributions from Alphabet. Staff at Google\nhave provided their time; Google as a business has provided both the infrastructure\nto serve packages, and the security context for giving those packages trustworthy\ndigital signatures.\nThese have been important to the adoption and growth of Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Releasing software might not be glamorous but it's important. Many people within\nthe Kubernetes contributor community have contributed to the new way that we, as a\nproject, have for building and publishing packages.</p>\n<p>And finally, we want to once again acknowledge the help from SUSE. OpenBuildService,\nfrom SUSE, is the technology that the powers the new community-managed package repositories.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-08-31 22:30:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/31/legacy-package-repository-deprecation/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":4501,"Title":"Cloudflare Radar’s 2023 overview of new tools and insights","Description":"In this reading list, we want to highlight some of the new additions to Radar, as well as some of the Internet disruptions and trends we’ve observed and published posts about during this year","PublishedAt":"2023-08-31 16:33:55+00:00","OriginURL":"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-radars-2023-overview-of-new-tools-and-insights/","SourceName":"Cloudflare"}},{"node":{"ID":4499,"Title":"How GitHub reduces costs with upgraded Codespaces","Description":"<p>See how much more you can get out of GitHub Codespaces by taking advantage of the improved processing power and increased headroom the RAM provides.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.blog/2023-08-31-how-github-reduces-costs-with-upgraded-codespaces/\">How GitHub reduces costs with upgraded Codespaces</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.blog\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\n","PublishedAt":"2023-08-31 15:00:52+00:00","OriginURL":"https://github.blog/2023-08-31-how-github-reduces-costs-with-upgraded-codespaces/","SourceName":"GitHub"}},{"node":{"ID":4502,"Title":"Enhancing Security and Developer Productivity: LinkedIn's Journey with Implementing Content Security Policy","Description":"LinkedIn Information Security is committed to help foster a community that is safe and secure for our members.

In\n2022, the Gateway API subproject started the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/gamma/\">GAMMA initiative</a>, a\ndedicated vendor-neutral workstream, specifically to examine how best to fit\nservice mesh support into the framework of the Gateway API resources, without\nrequiring users of Gateway API to relearn everything they understand about the\nAPI.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, GAMMA has dug deeply into the challenges and possible\nsolutions around using Gateway API for service mesh. The end result is a small\nnumber of <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/contributing/enhancement-requests/\">enhancement proposals</a> that subsume many hours of thought and\ndebate, and provide a minimum viable path to allow Gateway API to be used for\nservice mesh.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-will-mesh-routing-work-when-using-gateway-api\">How will mesh routing work when using Gateway API?</h3>\n<p>You can find all the details in the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/gamma/#how-the-gateway-api-works-for-service-mesh\">Gateway API Mesh routing\ndocumentation</a> and <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1426/\">GEP-1426</a>, but the short version for Gateway\nAPI v0.8.0 is that an HTTPRoute can now have a <code>parentRef</code> that is a Service,\nrather than just a Gateway. We anticipate future GEPs in this area as we gain\nmore experience with service mesh use cases -- binding to a Service makes it\npossible to use the Gateway API with a service mesh, but there are several\ninteresting use cases that remain difficult to cover.</p>\n<p>As an example, you might use an HTTPRoute to do an A-B test in the mesh as\nfollows:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre

<code>demo-app-v1</code>, while any request without that header\nwill be routed to <code>demo-app-v2</code> -- and since this is being handled by the\nservice mesh, not the ingress controller, the A/B test can happen anywhere in\nthe application's call graph.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-know-this-will-be-truly-portable\">How do I know this will be truly portable?</h3>\n<p>Gateway API has been investing heavily in conformance tests across all\nfeatures it supports, and mesh is no exception. One of the challenges that the\nGAMMA initiative ran into is that many of these tests were strongly tied to\nthe idea that a given implementation provides an ingress controller. Many\nservice meshes don't, and requiring a GAMMA-conformant mesh to also implement\nan ingress controller seemed impractical at best. This resulted in work\nrestarting on Gateway API <em>conformance profiles</em>, as discussed in <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1709/\">GEP-1709</a>.</p>\n<p>The basic idea of conformance profiles is that we can define subsets of the\nGateway API, and allow implementations to choose (and document) which subsets\nthey conform to. GAMMA is adding a new profile, named <code>Mesh</code> and described in\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1686/\">GEP-1686</a>, which checks only the mesh functionality as defined by GAMMA. At\nthis point, Kuma 2.3+, Linkerd 2.14+, and Istio 1.16+ are all conformant with\nthe <code>Mesh</code> profile.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-else-is-in-gateway-api-v0-8-0\">What else is in Gateway API v0.8.0?</h2>\n<p>This release is all about preparing Gateway API for the upcoming v1.0 release\nwhere HTTPRoute, Gateway, and GatewayClass will graduate to GA. There are two\nmain changes related to this: CEL validation and API version changes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cel-validation\">CEL Validation</h3>\n<p>The first major change is that Gateway API v0.8.0 is the start of a transition\nfrom webhook validation to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/\">CEL validation</a> using information built into\nthe CRDs. That will mean different things depending on the version of\nKubernetes you're using:</p>\n<h4 id=\"kubernetes-1-25\">Kubernetes 1.25+</h4>\n<p>CEL validation is fully supported, and almost all validation is implemented in\nCEL. (The sole exception is that header names in header modifier filters can\nonly do case-insensitive validation. There is more information in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/2277\">issue\n2277</a>.)</p>\n<p>We recommend <em>not</em> using the validating webhook on these Kubernetes versions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"kubernetes-1-23-and-1-24\">Kubernetes 1.23 and 1.24</h4>\n<p>CEL validation is not supported, but Gateway API v0.8.0 CRDs can still be\ninstalled. When you upgrade to Kubernetes 1.25+, the validation included in\nthese CRDs will automatically take effect.</p>\n<p>We recommend continuing to use the validating webhook on these Kubernetes\nversions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"kubernetes-1-22-and-older\">Kubernetes 1.22 and older</h4>\n<p>Gateway API only commits to support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/versioning/#supported-versions\">5 most recent versions of\nKubernetes</a>. As such, these versions are no longer\nsupported by Gateway API, and unfortunately Gateway API v0.8.0 cannot be\ninstalled on them, since CRDs containing CEL validation will be rejected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"api-version-changes\">API Version Changes</h3>\n<p>As we prepare for a v1.0 release that will graduate Gateway, GatewayClass, and\nHTTPRoute to the <code>v1</code> API Version from <code>v1beta1</code>, we are continuing the process\nof moving away from <code>v1alpha2</code> for resources that have graduated to <code>v1beta1</code>.\nFor more information on this change and everything else included in this\nrelease, refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v0.8.0\">v0.8.0 release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-get-started-with-gateway-api\">How can I get started with Gateway API?</h2>\n<p>Gateway API represents the future of load balancing, routing, and service mesh\nAPIs in Kubernetes. There are already more than 20 <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/\">implementations</a>\navailable (including both ingress controllers and service meshes) and the list\nkeeps growing.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in getting started with Gateway API, take a look at the\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/\">API concepts documentation</a> and check out some of the\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/getting-started/\">Guides</a> to try it out. Because this is a CRD-based API, you can\ninstall the latest version on any Kubernetes 1.23+ cluster.</p>\n<p>If you're specifically interested in helping to contribute to Gateway API, we\nwould love to have you!
