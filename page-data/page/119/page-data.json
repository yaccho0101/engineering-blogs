For AWS customers operating at global scale with many accounts and VPCs, AWS Transit Gateway greatly simplifies AWS networking architecture by eliminating the need to manage complex peering relationships and massive route tables.

For the first\ntime, several of our most important Gateway API resources are graduating to\nbeta. Additionally, we are starting a new initiative to explore how Gateway API\ncan be used for mesh and introducing new experimental concepts such as URL\nrewrites. We'll cover all of this and more below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-gateway-api\">What is Gateway API?</h2>\n<p>Gateway API is a collection of resources centered around <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway/\">Gateway</a> resources\n(which represent the underlying network gateways / proxy servers) to enable\nrobust Kubernetes service networking through expressive, extensible and\nrole-oriented interfaces that are implemented by many vendors and have broad\nindustry support.</p>\n<p>Originally conceived as a successor to the well known <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/ingress-v1/\">Ingress</a> API, the\nbenefits of Gateway API include (but are not limited to) explicit support for\nmany commonly used networking protocols (e.g. <code>HTTP</code>, <code>TLS</code>, <code>TCP</code>, <code>UDP</code>) as\nwell as tightly integrated support for Transport Layer Security (TLS). The\n<code>Gateway</code> resource in particular enables implementations to manage the lifecycle\nof network gateways as a Kubernetes API.</p>\n<p>If you're an end-user interested in some of the benefits of Gateway API we\ninvite you to jump in and find an implementation that suits you. At the time of\nthis release there are over a dozen <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/\">implementations</a> for popular API\ngateways and service meshes and guides are available to start exploring quickly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started</h3>\n<p>Gateway API is an official Kubernetes API like\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/\">Ingress</a>.\nGateway API represents a superset of Ingress functionality, enabling more\nadvanced concepts. Similar to Ingress, there is no default implementation of\nGateway API built into Kubernetes. Instead, there are many different\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/\">implementations</a> available, providing significant choice in terms of underlying\ntechnologies while providing a consistent and portable experience.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/\">API concepts documentation</a> and check out some of\nthe <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/getting-started/\">Guides</a> to start familiarizing yourself with the APIs and how they\nwork. When you're ready for a practical application open the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/\">implementations\npage</a> and select an implementation that belongs to an existing technology\nyou may already be familiar with or the one your cluster provider uses as a\ndefault (if applicable). Gateway API is a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/\">Custom Resource Definition\n(CRD)</a> based API so you'll need to <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/getting-started/#install-the-crds\">install the CRDs</a> onto a\ncluster to use the API.</p>\n<p>If you're specifically interested in helping to contribute to Gateway API, we\nwould love to have you! Please feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/new/choose\">open a new issue</a> on the\nrepository, or join in the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/discussions\">discussions</a>.
