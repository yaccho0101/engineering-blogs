They provide teams with a way to reflect on how they work and become better at what they do.

Here at SoundCloud, we hold retrospectives at the end of every iteration (every two weeks), and we often do them at the end of projects as well.","PublishedAt":"2018-06-22 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/defining-a-role-with-a-retrospective-activity","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":1147,"Title":"【退職エントリー】ニュースとテクノロジー","Description":"スマートニュースでプロダクトマネージャーをやっている西岡です。ついに、退職エントリーを書く日が来てしまいました。(※退職の詳細については後述","PublishedAt":"2018-06-21 05:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developer.smartnews.com/blog/2018/06/news_technology/","SourceName":"SmartNews"}},{"node":{"ID":306,"Title":"DevOps & Drinks @ GIPHY","Description":"June 21, 2018 GIPHY HQ &#8211; New York, NY GIPHY will host &#8216;DevOps &#038; Drinks&#8217; a meetup of DevOps Engineers in NYC who get together to discuss real world DevOps strategies with some of the top experts in their field, as well as conversations about the current state of the DevOps job market, employer hiring [&#8230;]","PublishedAt":"2018-06-18 14:12:12+00:00","OriginURL":"https://engineering.giphy.com/giphy-devops-drinks/","SourceName":"GIPHY"}},{"node":{"ID":671,"Title":"Interview with the Winners of trivago's New York Hackathon","Description":"On 11th of November 2017 trivago hosted a Hackathon at NASDAQ's MarketSite in New York.
