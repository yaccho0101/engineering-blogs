Throughout a typical Kubernetes release cycle, there are several deadlines that features need to meet to remain included. If a feature misses any of these deadlines, there is an exception process they can go through. Handling these exceptions is a very normal part of the release. But v1.27 is the first release that anyone can remember where we didn't receive a single exception request after the enhancements freeze. Even as the release progressed, things remained much calmer than any of us are used to.</p>\n<p>There's a specific reason we were able to enjoy a more calm release this time around, and that's all the work that folks put in behind the scenes to improve how we manage the release.

The Kubernetes project created and runs the <code>registry.k8s.io</code> image registry, which is fully controlled by the community.\nThis means that the old registry <code>k8s.gcr.io</code> will be frozen and no further images for Kubernetes and related sub-projects will be published to the old registry.</p>\n<p>What does this change mean for contributors?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are a maintainer of a sub-project, you will need to update your manifests and Helm charts to use the new registry. For more information, checkout this <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/community-images\">project</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What does this change mean for end users?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes <code>v1.27</code> release will not be published to the <code>k8s.gcr.io</code> registry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Patch releases for <code>v1.24</code>, <code>v1.25</code>, and <code>v1.26</code> will no longer be published to the old registry after April.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starting in v1.25, the default image registry has been set to <code>registry.k8s.io</code>. This value is overridable in kubeadm and kubelet but setting it to <code>k8s.gcr.io</code> will fail for new releases after April as they won’t be present in the old registry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to increase the reliability of your cluster and remove dependency on the community-owned registry or you are running Kubernetes in networks where external traffic is restricted, you should consider hosting local image registry mirrors. Some cloud vendors may offer hosted solutions for this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"seccompdefault-graduates-to-stable\"><code>SeccompDefault</code> graduates to stable</h2>\n<p>To use seccomp profile defaulting, you must run the kubelet with the <code>--seccomp-default</code> <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet\">command line flag</a> enabled for each node where you want to use it.\nIf enabled, the kubelet will use the <code>RuntimeDefault</code> seccomp profile by default, which is defined by the container runtime, instead of using the <code>Unconfined</code> (seccomp disabled) mode. The default profiles aim to provide a strong set of security defaults while preserving the functionality of the workload. It is possible that the default profiles differ between container runtimes and their release versions.</p>\n<p>You can find detailed information about a possible upgrade and downgrade strategy in the related Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP): <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2413-seccomp-by-default\">Enable seccomp by default</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mutable-scheduling-directives-for-jobs-graduates-to-ga\">Mutable scheduling directives for Jobs graduates to GA</h2>\n<p>This was introduced in v1.22 and started as a beta level, now it's stable. In most cases a parallel job will want the pods to run with constraints, like all in the same zone, or all either on GPU model x or y but not a mix of both. The <code>suspend</code> field is the first step towards achieving those semantics. <code>suspend</code> allows a custom queue controller to decide when a job should start. However, once a job is unsuspended, a custom queue controller has no influence on where the pods of a job will actually land.</p>\n<p>This feature allows updating a Job's scheduling directives before it starts, which gives custom queue controllers\nthe ability to influence pod placement while at the same time offloading actual pod-to-node assignment to\nkube-scheduler. This is allowed only for suspended Jobs that have never been unsuspended before.\nThe fields in a Job's pod template that can be updated are node affinity, node selector, tolerations, labels\n,annotations, and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-scheduling-readiness/\">scheduling gates</a>.\nFind more details in the KEP:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-scheduling/2926-job-mutable-scheduling-directives\">Allow updating scheduling directives of jobs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downwardapihugepages-graduates-to-stable\">DownwardAPIHugePages graduates to stable</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.20, support for <code>requests.hugepages-&lt;pagesize&gt;</code> and <code>limits.hugepages-&lt;pagesize&gt;</code> was added\nto the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/\">downward API</a> to be consistent with other resources like cpu, memory, and ephemeral storage.\nThis feature graduates to stable in this release. You can find more details in the KEP:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2053-downward-api-hugepages\">Downward API HugePages</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pod-scheduling-readiness-goes-to-beta\">Pod Scheduling Readiness goes to beta</h2>\n<p>Upon creation, Pods are ready for scheduling. Kubernetes scheduler does its due diligence to find nodes to place all pending Pods. However, in a real-world case, some Pods may stay in a <em>missing-essential-resources</em> state for a long period. These Pods actually churn the scheduler (and downstream integrators like Cluster Autoscaler) in an unnecessary manner.</p>\n<p>By specifying/removing a Pod's <code>.spec.schedulingGates</code>, you can control when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.</p>\n<p>The <code>schedulingGates</code> field contains a list of strings, and each string literal is perceived as a criteria that must be satisfied before a Pod is considered schedulable. This field can be initialized only when a Pod is created (either by the client, or mutated during admission). After creation, each schedulingGate can be removed in an arbitrary order, but addition of a new scheduling gate is disallowed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"node-log-access-via-kubernetes-api\">Node log access via Kubernetes API</h2>\n<p>This feature helps cluster administrators debug issues with services running on nodes by allowing them to query service logs. To use this feature, ensure that the <code>NodeLogQuery</code> <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a> is enabled on that node, and that the kubelet configuration options <code>enableSystemLogHandler</code> and <code>enableSystemLogQuery</code> are both set to true.\nOn Linux, we assume that service logs are available via journald. On Windows, we assume that service logs are available in the application log provider. You can also fetch logs from the <code>/var/log/</code> and <code>C:\\var\\log</code> directories on Linux and Windows, respectively.</p>\n<p>A cluster administrator can try out this alpha feature across all nodes of their cluster, or on a subset of them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readwriteoncepod-persistentvolume-access-mode-goes-to-beta\">ReadWriteOncePod PersistentVolume access mode goes to beta</h2>\n<p>Kuberentes <code>v1.22</code> introduced a new access mode <code>ReadWriteOncePod</code> for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volumes\">PersistentVolumes</a> (PVs) and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims\">PersistentVolumeClaims</a> (PVCs). This access mode enables you to restrict volume access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads that require single-writer access to storage.</p>\n<p>The ReadWriteOncePod beta adds support for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/\">scheduler preemption</a>\nof pods that use ReadWriteOncePod PVCs.\nScheduler preemption allows higher-priority pods to preempt lower-priority pods. For example when a pod (A) with a <code>ReadWriteOncePod</code> PVC is scheduled, if another pod (B) is found using the same PVC and pod (A) has higher priority, the scheduler will return an <code>Unschedulable</code> status and attempt to preempt pod (B).\nFor more context, see the KEP: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/2485-read-write-once-pod-pv-access-mode\">ReadWriteOncePod PersistentVolume AccessMode</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"respect-podtopologyspread-after-rolling-upgrades\">Respect PodTopologySpread after rolling upgrades</h2>\n<p><code>matchLabelKeys</code> is a list of pod label keys used to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the pod labels. Those key-value labels are ANDed with <code>labelSelector</code> to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. Keys that don't exist in the pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against the <code>labelSelector</code>.</p>\n<p>With <code>matchLabelKeys</code>, users don't need to update the <code>pod.spec</code> between different revisions. The controller/operator just needs to set different values to the same <code>label</code> key for different revisions. The scheduler will assume the values automatically based on <code>matchLabelKeys</code>. For example, if users use Deployment, they can use the label keyed with <code>pod-template-hash</code>, which is added automatically by the Deployment controller, to distinguish between different revisions in a single Deployment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faster-selinux-volume-relabeling-using-mounts\">Faster SELinux volume relabeling using mounts</h2>\n<p>In this release, how SELinux labels are applied to volumes used by Pods is graduating to beta. This feature speeds up container startup by mounting volumes with the correct SELinux label instead of changing each file on the volumes recursively. Linux kernel with SELinux support allows the first mount of a volume to set SELinux label on the whole volume using <code>-o context=</code> mount option. This way, all files will have assigned the given label in a constant time, without recursively walking through the whole volumes.</p>\n<p>The <code>context</code> mount option cannot be applied to bind mounts or re-mounts of already mounted volumes.\nFor CSI storage, a CSI driver does the first mount of a volume, and so it must be the CSI driver that actually\napplies this mount option. We added a new field <code>SELinuxMount</code> to CSIDriver objects, so that drivers can\nannounce whether they support the <code>-o context</code> mount option.</p>\n<p>If Kubernetes knows the SELinux label of a Pod <strong>and</strong> the CSI driver responsible for a pod's volume\nannounces <code>SELinuxMount: true</code> <strong>and</strong> the volume has Access Mode <code>ReadWriteOncePod</code>, then it\nwill ask the CSI driver to mount the volume with mount option <code>context=</code> <strong>and</strong> it will tell the container\nruntime not to relabel content of the volume (because all files already have the right label).\nGet more information on this from the KEP: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/1710-selinux-relabeling\">Speed up SELinux volume relabeling using mounts</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"robust-volumemanager-reconstruction-goes-to-beta\">Robust VolumeManager reconstruction goes to beta</h2>\n<p>This is a volume manager refactoring that allows the kubelet to populate additional information about how\nexisting volumes are mounted during the kubelet startup. In general, this makes volume cleanup more robust.\nIf you enable the <code>NewVolumeManagerReconstruction</code> feature gate on a node, you'll get enhanced discovery of mounted volumes during kubelet startup.</p>\n<p>Before Kubernetes v1.25, the kubelet used different default behavior for discovering mounted volumes during the kubelet startup. If you disable this feature gate (it's enabled by default), you select the legacy discovery behavior.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.25 and v1.26, this behavior toggle was part of the <code>SELinuxMountReadWriteOncePod</code> feature gate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mutable-pod-scheduling-directives-goes-to-beta\">Mutable Pod Scheduling Directives goes to beta</h2>\n<p>This allows mutating a pod that is blocked on a scheduling readiness gate with a more constrained node affinity/selector. It gives the ability to mutate a pods scheduling directives before it is allowed to be scheduled and gives an external resource controller the ability to influence pod placement while at the same time offload actual pod-to-node assignment to kube-scheduler.</p>\n<p>This opens the door for a new pattern of adding scheduling features to Kubernetes. Specifically, building lightweight schedulers that implement features not supported by kube-scheduler, while relying on the existing kube-scheduler to support all upstream features and handle the pod-to-node binding. This pattern should be the preferred one if the custom feature doesn't require implementing a schedule plugin, which entails re-building and maintaining a custom kube-scheduler binary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feature-graduations-and-deprecations-in-kubernetes-v1-27\">Feature graduations and deprecations in Kubernetes v1.27</h2>\n<h3 id=\"graduations-to-stable\">Graduations to stable</h3>\n<p>This release includes a total of 9 enhancements promoted to Stable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2227\">Default container annotation that to be used by kubectl</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3140\">TimeZone support in CronJob</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1748\">Expose metrics about resource requests and limits that represent the pod model</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2885\">Server Side Unknown Field Validation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/693\">Node Topology Manager</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2727\">Add gRPC probe to Pod.Spec.Container.{Liveness,Readiness,Startup} Probe</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2238\">Add configurable grace period to probes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2896\">OpenAPI v3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3744\">Stay on supported Go versions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"deprecations-and-removals\">Deprecations and removals</h3>\n<p>This release saw several removals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108445\">Removal of <code>storage.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> from CSIStorageCapacity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/114947\">Removal of support for deprecated seccomp annotations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112797\">Removal of <code>--master-service-namespace</code> command line argument</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113534\">Removal of the <code>ControllerManagerLeaderMigration</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111411\">Removal of <code>--enable-taint-manager</code> command line argument</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113710\">Removal of <code>--pod-eviction-timeout</code> command line argument</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110410\">Removal of the <code>CSI Migration</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111258\">Removal of <code>CSIInlineVolume</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111402\">Removal of <code>EphemeralContainers</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111513\">Removal of <code>LocalStorageCapacityIsolation</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110868\">Removal of <code>NetworkPolicyEndPort</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110896\">Removal of <code>StatefulSetMinReadySeconds</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111229\">Removal of <code>IdentifyPodOS</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111194\">Removal of <code>DaemonSetUpdateSurge</code> feature gate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"release-notes\">Release notes</h2>\n<p>The complete details of the Kubernetes v1.27 release are available in our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"availability\">Availability</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.27 is available for download on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.27.0\">GitHub</a>.

Below, we'll walk through what you need to do to expand your deployment so you can start gathering metrics from application performance monitoring (APM) or \"tracing\" data in your observability cluster, for free.</span></p><h2>What is APM?</h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Application performance monitoring lets you see where your applications spend their time, what they are doing, what other applications or services they are calling, and what errors or exceptions they are encountering.</span></p><p><img alt=\"distributed-trace.png\" src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt4f2c901a48e81d2f/6090052af6a831100b5deb25/distributed-trace.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt4f2c901a48e81d2f\"/></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">In addition, APM also lets you see history and trends for key performance indicators, such as latency and throughput, as well as transaction and dependency information:</span></p><p><img alt=\"ruby-overview.png\" src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt0aee881105724120/609005407cc444103417ec49/ruby-overview.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt0aee881105724120\"/></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Whether you're setting up alerts for SLA breaches, trying to gauge the impact of your latest release, or deciding where to make the next improvement, APM can help with your root-cause analysis to help improve your users' experience and drive your mean time to resolution (MTTR) toward zero.</span></p><h2>Logical architecture</h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Elastic APM relies on the APM Integration inside Elastic Agent, which forwards application trace and metric data from applications instrumented with APM agents to an Elastic Observability cluster. Elastic APM supports multiple agent flavors:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Native Elastic APM Agents, available for </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/index.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">multiple languages</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">, including Java, .NET, Go, Ruby, Python, Node.js,&nbsp; PHP, and client-side JavaScript</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Code instrumented with </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/get-started/current/open-telemetry-elastic.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">OpenTelemetry</span></a></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Code instrumented with </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/get-started/current/opentracing.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">OpenTracing</span></a></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Code instrumented with </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/server/current/jaeger.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Jaeger</span></a></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt530d9030ca5005ff/642f342ab2ef0d11ece9fa69/blog-elastic-observability-instrumented-services.png\" height=\"auto\"/></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">In this blog, we'll provide a quick example of how to instrument code with the native Elastic APM Python agent, but the overall steps are similar for other languages.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Please note that there is a strong distinction between the </span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Elastic APM Agent </strong></span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">and the</span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\"><strong> Elastic Agent</strong></span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">. These are very different components, as you can see in the diagram above, so it’s important not to confuse them.</span></p><h2>Install the Elastic Agent</h2><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The first step is to install the Elastic Agent. You either need Fleet </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/add-a-fleet-server.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">installed first</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, or you can install the Elastic Agent standalone. Install the Elastic Agent somewhere by </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/master/elastic-agent-installation.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">following this guide</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This will give you an APM Integration endpoint you can hit. Note that this step is not necessary in Elastic Cloud, as we host the APM Integration for you. Check Elastic Agent is up by running:</span></p><pre class=\"prettyprint\"><span style='color:rgb(252, 194, 140);font-size: 12pt;'>curl</span><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 12pt;'> </span><span style='color:rgb(252, 194, 140);font-size: 12pt;'>&lt;ELASTIC_AGENT_HOSTNAME&gt;</span><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 12pt;'>:8200</span></pre><h2>Instrumenting sample code with an Elastic APM agent</h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">The instructions for the various language agents differ based on the programming language, but at a high level they have a similar flow. First, you add the dependency for the agent in the language's native spec, then you configure the agent to let it know how to find the APM Integration.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">You can try out any flavor you'd like, but I am going to walk through the Python instructions using this Python example that </span><a href=\"https://github.com/davidgeorgehope/PythonElasticAPMExample\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I created</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">.</span></p><h3>Get the sample code (or use your own)</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To get started, I clone the GitHub repository then change to the directory:</span></p><pre><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 11.5pt;'>git </span><span style='color:rgb(252, 194, 140);font-size: 11.5pt;'>clone</span><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 11.5pt;'> </span><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 170);font-size: 11.5pt;'>https://github.com/davidgeorgehope/PythonElasticAPMExample</span><br/><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 11.5pt;'>cd </span><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 170);font-size: 11.5pt;'>PythonElasticAPMExample</span></pre><h3>How to add the dependency</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Adding the Elastic APM Dependency is simple — check the app.py file from</span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\"> </span><a href=\"https://github.com/davidgeorgehope/PythonElasticAPMExample/blob/main/app.py\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">the github repo</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">and you will notice the following lines of code.</span></p><p><pre class=\"prettyprint\"><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 12pt;'>import elasticapm</span><br/><span style='color:rgb(252, 194, 140);font-size: 12pt;'>from</span><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 12pt;'> elasticapm import</span><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 170);font-size: 12pt;'> Client</span><br/><br/><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 12pt;'>app = Flask(__name__)</span><br/><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 12pt;'>app.config[</span><span style='color:rgb(162, 252, 162);font-size: 12pt;'>\"ELASTIC_APM\"</span><span style='color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 12pt;'>] = {&nbsp;

Versions","Description":"<p><strong>Author</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/liggitt\">Jordan Liggitt</a> (Google)</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h3>\n<p>Since v1.19 (released in 2020), the Kubernetes project provides 12-14 months of patch releases for each minor version.\nThis enables users to qualify and adopt Kubernetes versions in an annual upgrade cycle and receive security fixes for a year.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle#release-maintenance\">Go project</a> releases new minor versions twice a year,\nand provides security fixes for the last two minor versions, resulting in about a year of support for each Go version.\nEven though each new Kubernetes minor version is built with a supported Go version when it is first released,\nthat Go version falls out of support before the Kubernetes minor version does,\nand the lengthened Kubernetes patch support since v1.19 only widened that gap.</p>\n<p>At the time this was written, just over half of all <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/devel/release\">Go patch releases</a> (88/171) have contained fixes for issues with possible security implications.\nEven though many of these issues were not relevant to Kubernetes, some were, so it remained important to use supported Go versions that received those fixes.</p>\n<p>An obvious solution would be to simply update Kubernetes release branches to new minor versions of Go.\nHowever, Kubernetes avoids <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-release/cherry-picks.md#what-kind-of-prs-are-good-for-cherry-picks\">destabilizing changes in patch releases</a>,\nand historically, this prevented updating existing release branches to new minor versions of Go, due to changes that were considered prohibitively complex, risky, or breaking to include in a patch release.\nExamples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go 1.6: enabling http/2 by default</li>\n<li>Go 1.14: EINTR handling issues</li>\n<li>Go 1.17: dropping x509 CN support, ParseIP changes</li>\n<li>Go 1.18: disabling x509 SHA-1 certificate support by default</li>\n<li>Go 1.19: dropping current-dir LookPath behavior</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these changes could be easily mitigated in Kubernetes code,\nsome could only be opted out of via a user-specified <code>GODEBUG</code> envvar,\nand others required invasive code changes or could not be avoided at all.\nBecause of this inconsistency, Kubernetes release branches have typically remained on a single Go minor version,\nand risked being unable to pick up relevant Go security fixes for the last several months of each Kubernetes minor version's support lifetime.</p>\n<p>When a relevant Go security fix was only available in newer Kubernetes minor versions,\nusers would have to upgrade away from older Kubernetes minor versions before their 12-14 month support period ended, just to pick up those fixes.\nIf a user was not prepared to do that upgrade, it could result in vulnerable Kubernetes clusters.\nEven if a user could accommodate the unexpected upgrade, the uncertainty made Kubernetes' annual support less reliable for planning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solution\">The solution</h3>\n<p>We're happy to announce that the gap between supported Kubernetes versions and supported Go versions has been resolved as of January 2023.</p>\n<p>We worked closely with the Go team over the past year to address the difficulties adopting new Go versions.\nThis prompted a <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/55090\">discussion</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56986\">proposal</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v24wrd3RwGo\">talk at GopherCon</a>, and a <a href=\"https://go.dev/design/56986-godebug\">design</a> for improving backward compatibility in Go,\nensuring new Go versions can maintain compatible runtime behavior with previous Go versions for a minimum of two years (four Go releases).\nThis allows projects like Kubernetes to update release branches to supported Go versions without exposing users to behavior changes.</p>\n<p>The proposed improvements are on track to be <a href=\"https://tip.golang.org/doc/godebug\">included in Go 1.21</a>, and the Go team already delivered targeted compatibility improvements in a Go 1.19 patch release in late 2022.\nThose changes enabled Kubernetes 1.23+ to update to Go 1.19 in January of 2023, while avoiding any user-facing configuration or behavior changes.\nAll supported Kubernetes release branches now use supported Go versions, and can pick up new Go patch releases with available security fixes.</p>\n<p>Going forward, Kubernetes maintainers remain committed to making Kubernetes patch releases as safe and non-disruptive as possible,\nso there are several requirements a new Go minor version must meet before existing Kubernetes release branches will update to use it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The new Go version must be available for at least 3 months.\nThis gives time for adoption by the Go community, and for reports of issues or regressions.</li>\n<li>The new Go version must be used in a new Kubernetes minor release for at least 1 month.\nThis ensures all Kubernetes release-blocking tests pass on the new Go version,\nand gives time for feedback from the Kubernetes community on release candidates and early adoption of the new minor release.</li>\n<li>There must be no regressions from the previous Go version known to impact Kubernetes.</li>\n<li>Runtime behavior must be preserved by default, without requiring any action by Kubernetes users / administrators.</li>\n<li>Kubernetes libraries like <code>k8s.io/client-go</code> must remain compatible with the original Go version used for each minor release,\nso consumers won't <em>have</em> to update Go versions to pick up a library patch release (though they are encouraged to build with supported Go versions,\nwhich is made even easier with the <a href=\"https://go.dev/design/56986-godebug\">compatibility improvements</a> planned in Go 1.21).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal of all of this work is to unobtrusively make Kubernetes patch releases safer and more secure,\nand to make Kubernetes minor versions safe to use for the entire duration of their support lifetime.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to the Go team, especially Russ Cox, for helping drive these improvements in ways that will benefit all Go users, not just Kubernetes.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-04-06
