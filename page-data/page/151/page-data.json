The main parts of the hotel search are built with PHP and the Symfony Framework for the frontend (web) and Java for the backend part. In this article, we will focus on the collaboration between our PHP application and Redis. Both are running fine, but it was a long and hard way up to the current situation. This is the story of how we learned to use Redis, including our failures and experience.","PublishedAt":"2017-01-25 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://tech.trivago.com/post/learn-redis-the-hard-way/","SourceName":"Trivago"}},{"node":{"ID":693,"Title":"Code Review: Best Practices and Common Pitfalls","Description":"At trivago we have been using code reviews as a part of our process for a good while now.
