But this transition creates significant security risks that they may be unable to keep pace with. For example, cyber attacks on cloud resources are becoming more sophisticated and prevalent. Additionally, organizations often rely on legacy, disjointed security tools that don&rsquo;t integrate well with cloud-native infrastructure. This disconnect makes it more difficult for them to trace the path of an attack and collaborate with DevOps to remediate the vulnerability.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/security-context-with-datadog-cloud-security-management/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1990,"Title":"Announcing PCI-Compliant Log Management and APM from Datadog","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/datadog-pci-compliance-log-management-apm/dash-2022-pci-compliance-log-management-apm-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>For any organization that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data, monitoring can pose a particular set of challenges. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) dictates rigorous monitoring and data security requirements for the cardholder data environments (CDEs) of all merchants, service providers, and financial institutions. In order to meet these requirements, many organizations have resorted to using multiple monitoring platforms, funneling PCI-regulated data and non-PCI-regulated data into separate silos.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-pci-compliance-log-management-apm/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1991,"Title":"Automate end-to-end processes and quickly respond to events with Datadog Workflows","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/automate-end-to-end-processes-with-datadog-workflows/managed-workflows_hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Developer, SRE, IT, and security teams tend to rely on complex manual procedures to respond to disruptions and other unforeseen changes that arise in their systems. These manual responses typically involve multiple steps with context-switching, and they often require significant expertise. Incident responses are also subject to the constraints of other processes and procedures that are already in place. All of these factors combine to prolong incident response time while also making a team&rsquo;s incident handling highly susceptible to errors and misconfigurations.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/automate-end-to-end-processes-with-datadog-workflows/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1992,"Title":"Dash 2022: Guide to Datadog's newest announcements","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/dash-2022-new-feature-roundup/dash-2022-roundup-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Today at Dash 2022, we announced new products and features that enable your teams to break down information silos, shift testing to the left, monitor cloud and application security, and more.

But in practice, it&rsquo;s difficult for organizations to gain a high degree of clarity about their cloud spending. The factors contributing to cost data are not normally visible to all stakeholders, and it&rsquo;s often impossible to attribute costs to the teams, services, and applications that incurred them. Additionally, engineering teams have lacked a way to view cost data in the context of the telemetry they already use for maintaining the performance and reliability of their services.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/control-your-cloud-spend-with-datadog-cloud-cost-management/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1994,"Title":"Identify and redact sensitive data in APM, RUM, and Events stream with Sensitive Data Scanner","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/identify-sensitive-data-leakage-in-apm-rum-with-sensitive-data-scanner/hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Customer-facing applications request and process many types of sensitive data, such as API keys, credit card numbers, and email addresses.

However, deploying new code is typically accompanied by tests, and as the codebase expands, this results in a proportionately larger test suite. When an entire test suite needs to run in order to validate each small code change, testing can feel more like a chore rather than an integral part of the development process, creating a cumbersome feedback cycle for developers.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/streamline-ci-testing-with-datadog-intelligent-test-runner/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1997,"Title":"Use Datadog Continuous Testing to release with confidence","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/release-confidently-with-datadog-continuous-testing/continuous_testing_hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Testing early and often in the development cycle is a must for ensuring that your application meets user expectations. Poor performance and errors can alienate users and prevent you from meeting crucial benchmarks and OKRs. Additionally, having to constantly implement fixes after new, under-tested features are added can fatigue developers and strain your resources, making your organization less nimble overall. By integrating testing at every stage of the application development process, you can catch critical issues before release and help ensure the best possible user experience on every device and browser.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/release-confidently-with-datadog-continuous-testing/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":2005,"Title":"HIPAA-Eligible Services","Description":"As of the date displayed above, the following Datadog Services are included as &ldquo;Eligible Services&rdquo; under the applicable Datadog Business Associate Agreement.Cloud SIEM (formerly Security Monitoring) Log Management As of the date displayed above, the following Datadog Services are included as “Extended Eligible Services” under the applicable Datadog Business Associate Agreement.Application Performance Monitoring Audit Trail CI Visibility Cloud Security Posture Management Cloud SIEM Cloud Workload Security Continuous Profiler Database Monitoring Incident Management Infrastructure Monitoring Log Management Network Device Monitoring Network Performance Monitoring Real User Monitoring Sensitive Data Scanner Serverless Monitoring Session Replay Synthetic Monitoring","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/legal/hipaa-eligible-services/2022-10-19/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1984,"Title":"Orchestrating Data/ML Workflows at Scale With Netflix Maestro","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-10-18 20:43:36+00:00","OriginURL":"https://netflixtechblog.com/orchestrating-data-ml-workflows-at-scale-with-netflix-maestro-aaa2b41b800c?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4","SourceName":"Netflix"}},{"node":{"ID":1983,"Title":"Reviewing CVE-2022-42889: The Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability in Apache Commons Text","Description":"In this post we'll review CVE-2022-42889, the recent Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability in Apache Commons Text, including what it is, how to remediate it, and why it's not the new Log4Shell.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-18 18:09:47+00:00","OriginURL":"https://snyk.io/blog/reviewing-cve-2022-42889-in-apache-commons-text/","SourceName":"Snyk"}},{"node":{"ID":1982,"Title":"Internet disruptions overview for Q3 2022","Description":"In this post, we review selected Internet disruptions observed by Cloudflare during the second quarter of 2022, supported by traffic graphs from Cloudflare Radar and other internal Cloudflare tools, and grouped by associated cause or common geography","PublishedAt":"2022-10-18 17:36:04+00:00","OriginURL":"https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2022-internet-disruption-summary/","SourceName":"Cloudflare"}},{"node":{"ID":1980,"Title":"OCP Summit 2022: Open hardware for AI infrastructure","Description":"<p>At OCP Summit 2022, we’re announcing Grand Teton, our next-generation platform for AI at scale that we’ll contribute to the OCP community.
