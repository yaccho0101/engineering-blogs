However, migrating to the cloud can often be a complex and daunting task. For instance, if an organization is a Microsoft shop with teams that rely on SQL Server databases, Azure is a natural fit for its needs.","PublishedAt":"2023-03-22 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/migrate-sql-workloads-to-azure-with-datadog/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":3240,"Title":"Identify the root causes of issues and bottlenecks in your build pipelines with TeamCity and Datadog","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/monitor-team-city-with-datadog/hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>TeamCity is a CI/CD server that provides out-of-the-box support for unit testing, code quality tracking, and build automation.

This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release, it will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after the deprecation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"api-removals-and-other-changes-for-kubernetes-v1-27\">API removals, and other changes for Kubernetes v1.27</h2>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-storage-k8s-io-v1beta1-from-csistoragecapacity\">Removal of <code>storage.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> from <code>CSIStorageCapacity</code></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/config-and-storage-resources/csi-storage-capacity-v1/\">CSIStorageCapacity</a> API supports exposing currently available storage capacity via CSIStorageCapacity objects and enhances the scheduling of pods that use CSI volumes with late binding. The <code>storage.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> API version of CSIStorageCapacity was deprecated in v1.24, and it will no longer be served in v1.27.</p>\n<p>Migrate manifests and API clients to use the <code>storage.k8s.io/v1</code> API version, available since v1.24. All existing persisted objects are accessible via the new API.</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/1472-storage-capacity-tracking\">Storage Capacity Constraints for Pod Scheduling KEP</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.27 is not removing any other APIs; however several other aspects are going\nto be removed. Read on for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-deprecated-seccomp-annotations\">Support for deprecated seccomp annotations</h3>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.19, the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/135-seccomp\">seccomp</a> (secure computing mode) support graduated to General Availability (GA). This feature can be used to increase the workload security by restricting the system calls for a Pod (applies to all containers) or single containers.</p>\n<p>The support for the alpha seccomp annotations <code>seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod</code> and <code>container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io</code> were deprecated since v1.19, now have been completely removed. The seccomp fields are no longer auto-populated when pods with seccomp annotations are created. Pods should use the corresponding pod or container <code>securityContext.seccompProfile</code> field instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-several-feature-gates-for-volume-expansion\">Removal of several feature gates for volume expansion</h3>\n<p>The following feature gates for <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/284\">volume expansion</a> GA features will be removed and must no longer be referenced in <code>--feature-gates</code> flags:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>ExpandCSIVolumes</code></dt>\n<dd>Enable expanding of CSI volumes.</dd>\n<dt><code>ExpandInUsePersistentVolumes</code></dt>\n<dd>Enable expanding in-use PVCs.</dd>\n<dt><code>ExpandPersistentVolumes</code></dt>\n<dd>Enable expanding of persistent volumes.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-master-service-namespace-command-line-argument\">Removal of <code>--master-service-namespace</code> command line argument</h3>\n<p>The kube-apiserver accepts a deprecated command line argument, <code>--master-service-namespace</code>, that specified where to create the Service named <code>kubernetes</code>\nto represent the API server.\nKubernetes v1.27 will remove that argument, which has been deprecated since the v1.26 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-the-controllermanagerleadermigration-feature-gate\">Removal of the <code>ControllerManagerLeaderMigration</code> feature gate</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2436\">Leader Migration</a> provides a mechanism in which HA clusters can safely migrate &quot;cloud-specific&quot; controllers between the <code>kube-controller-manager</code> and the <code>cloud-controller-manager</code> via a shared resource lock between the two components while upgrading the replicated control plane.</p>\n<p>The <code>ControllerManagerLeaderMigration</code> feature, GA since v1.24, is unconditionally enabled and for the v1.27 release the feature gate option will be removed. If you're setting this feature gate explicitly, you'll need to remove that from command line arguments or configuration files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-enable-taint-manager-command-line-argument\">Removal of <code>--enable-taint-manager</code> command line argument</h3>\n<p>The kube-controller-manager command line argument <code>--enable-taint-manager</code> is deprecated, and will be removed in Kubernetes v1.27. The feature that it supports, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#taint-based-evictions\">taint based eviction</a>,\nis already enabled by default and will continue to be implicitly enabled when the flag is removed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-pod-eviction-timeout-command-line-argument\">Removal of <code>--pod-eviction-timeout</code> command line argument</h3>\n<p>The deprecated command line argument <code>--pod-eviction-timeout</code> will be removed from the\nkube-controller-manager.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-the-csi-migration-feature-gate\">Removal of the <code>CSI Migration</code> feature gate</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/625\">CSI migration</a> programme allows\nmoving from in-tree volume plugins to out-of-tree CSI drivers. CSI migration is generally available since Kubernetes v1.16, and the associated <code>CSIMigration</code> feature gate will be removed in v1.27.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-csiinlinevolume-feature-gate\">Removal of <code>CSIInlineVolume</code> feature gate</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111258\">CSI Ephemeral Volume</a> feature allows CSI volumes to be specified directly in the pod specification for ephemeral use cases. They can be used to inject arbitrary states, such as configuration, secrets, identity, variables or similar information, directly inside pods using a mounted volume. This feature graduated to GA in v1.25. Hence, the feature gate <code>CSIInlineVolume</code> will be removed in the v1.27 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-ephemeralcontainers-feature-gate\">Removal of <code>EphemeralContainers</code> feature gate</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/\">Ephemeral containers</a> graduated to GA in v1.25. These are containers with a temporary duration that executes within namespaces of an existing pod. Ephemeral containers are typically initiated by a user in order to observe the state of other pods and containers for troubleshooting and debugging purposes. For Kubernetes v1.27, API support for ephemeral containers is unconditionally enabled; the <code>EphemeralContainers</code> feature gate will be removed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-localstoragecapacityisolation-feature-gate\">Removal of <code>LocalStorageCapacityIsolation</code> feature gate</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111513\">Local Ephemeral Storage Capacity Isolation</a> feature moved to GA in v1.25. The feature provides support for capacity isolation of local ephemeral storage between pods, such as <code>emptyDir</code> volumes, so that a pod can be hard limited in its consumption of shared resources. The kubelet will evicting Pods if consumption of local ephemeral storage exceeds the configured limit. The feature gate, <code>LocalStorageCapacityIsolation</code>, will be removed in the v1.27 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-networkpolicyendport-feature-gate\">Removal of <code>NetworkPolicyEndPort</code> feature gate</h3>\n<p>The v1.25 release of Kubernetes promoted <code>endPort</code> in NetworkPolicy to GA. NetworkPolicy providers that support the <code>endPort</code> field that can be used to specify a range of ports to apply a NetworkPolicy. Previously, each NetworkPolicy could only target a single port. So the feature gate <code>NetworkPolicyEndPort</code> will be removed in this release.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that <code>endPort</code> field must be supported by the Network Policy provider. If your provider does not support <code>endPort</code>, and this field is specified in a Network Policy, the Network Policy will be created covering only the port field (single port).</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-statefulsetminreadyseconds-feature-gate\">Removal of <code>StatefulSetMinReadySeconds</code> feature gate</h3>\n<p>For a pod that is part of a StatefulSet, Kubernetes can mark the Pod ready only if Pod is available (and passing checks) for at least the period you specify in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#minimum-ready-seconds\"><code>minReadySeconds</code></a>. The feature became generally available in Kubernetes v1.25, and the <code>StatefulSetMinReadySeconds</code> feature gate will be locked to true and removed in the v1.27 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-identifypodos-feature-gate\">Removal of <code>IdentifyPodOS</code> feature gate</h3>\n<p>You can specify the operating system for a Pod, and the feature support for that is stable since the v1.25 release. The <code>IdentifyPodOS</code> feature gate will be removed for Kubernetes v1.27.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-daemonsetupdatesurge-feature-gate\">Removal of <code>DaemonSetUpdateSurge</code> feature gate</h3>\n<p>The v1.25 release of Kubernetes also stabilised surge support for DaemonSet pods, implemented in order to minimize DaemonSet downtime during rollouts.
