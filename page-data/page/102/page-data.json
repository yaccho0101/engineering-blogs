This graduation helps to align this functionality across the workloads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-problems-do-these-features-solve\">What problems do these features solve?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"solved-problem-statefulset-minreadyseconds\">minReadySeconds for StatefulSets</h3>\n<p><code>minReadySeconds</code> ensures that the StatefulSet workload is <code>Ready</code> for the given number of seconds before reporting the\npod as <code>Available</code>. The notion of being <code>Ready</code> and <code>Available</code> is quite important for workloads. For example, some workloads, like Prometheus with multiple instances of Alertmanager, should be considered <code>Available</code> only when the Alertmanager's state transfer is complete. <code>minReadySeconds</code> also helps when using loadbalancers with cloud providers. Since the pod should be <code>Ready</code> for the given number of seconds, it provides buffer time to prevent killing pods in rotation before new pods show up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-use-daemonset-maxsurge\">maxSurge for DaemonSets</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes system-level components like CNI, CSI are typically run as DaemonSets. These components can have impact on the availability of the workloads if those DaemonSets go down momentarily during the upgrades. The feature allows DaemonSet pods to temporarily increase their number, thereby ensuring zero-downtime for the DaemonSets.</p>\n<p>Please note that the usage of <code>hostPort</code> in conjunction with <code>maxSurge</code> in DaemonSets is not allowed as DaemonSet pods are tied to a single node and two active pods cannot share the same port on the same node.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-statefulset-minreadyseconds-work\">minReadySeconds for StatefulSets</h3>\n<p>The StatefulSet controller watches for the StatefulSet pods and counts how long a particular pod has been in the <code>Running</code> state, if this value is greater than or equal to the time specified in <code>.spec.minReadySeconds</code> field of the StatefulSet, the StatefulSet controller updates the <code>AvailableReplicas</code> field in the StatefulSet's status.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-daemonset-maxsurge-work\">maxSurge for DaemonSets</h3>\n<p>The DaemonSet controller creates the additional pods (above the desired number resulting from DaemonSet spec) based on the value given in <code>.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge</code>. The additional pods would run on the same node where the old DaemonSet pod is running till the old pod gets killed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default value is 0.</li>\n<li>The value cannot be <code>0</code> when <code>MaxUnavailable</code> is 0.</li>\n<li>The value can be specified either as an absolute number of pods, or a percentage (rounded up) of desired pods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-use-statefulset-minreadyseconds\">minReadySeconds for StatefulSets</h3>\n<p>Specify a value for <code>minReadySeconds</code> for any StatefulSet and check if pods are available or not by inspecting\n<code>AvailableReplicas</code> field using:</p>\n<p><code>kubectl get statefulset/&lt;name_of_the_statefulset&gt; -o yaml</code></p>\n<p>Please note that the default value of <code>minReadySeconds</code> is 0.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-use-daemonset-maxsurge\">maxSurge for DaemonSets</h3>\n<p>Specify a value for <code>.spec.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge</code> and set <code>.spec.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable</code> to <code>0</code>.</p>\n<p>Then observe a faster rollout and higher number of pods running at the same time in the next rollout.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>kubectl rollout restart daemonset &lt;name_of_the_daemonset&gt;\nkubectl get pods -w\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn more?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"learn-more-statefulset-minreadyseconds\">minReadySeconds for StatefulSets</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation: <a href=\"https://k8s.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#minimum-ready-seconds\">https://k8s.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#minimum-ready-seconds</a></li>\n<li>KEP: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2599\">https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2599</a></li>\n<li>API Changes: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100842\">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100842</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"learn-more-daemonset-maxsurge\">maxSurge for DaemonSets</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation: <a href=\"https://k8s.io/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set/\">https://k8s.io/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set/</a></li>\n<li>KEP: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1591\">https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1591</a></li>\n<li>API Changes: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96375\">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96375</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-involved\">How do I get involved?</h2>\n<p>Please reach out to us on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C18NZM5K9\">#sig-apps</a> channel on Slack, or through the SIG Apps mailing list <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-apps\">kubernetes-sig-apps@googlegroups.com</a>.</p>","PublishedAt":"2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/15/app-rollout-features-reach-stable/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":1673,"Title":"Datadog Spotlight: Stephanie Molano","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/pup-culture/datadog-spotlight-steph-molano/datadog_employee_spotlight_steph.png\" width=\"100%\"/>This month, we’re excited to feature Stephanie Molano, one of our Commercial Account Executives based out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The kubelet, for a worker node,\nwill use the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to accurately surface the initialization\nstate of a pod from the perspective of pod sandbox creation and network\nconfiguration by a container runtime (typically in coordination with CNI\nplugins). The kubelet starts to pull container images and start individual\ncontainers (including init containers) after the status of the <code>PodHasNetwork</code>\ncondition is set to <code>True</code>. Metrics collection services that report latency of\npod initialization from a cluster infrastructural perspective (i.e. agnostic of\nper container characteristics like image size or payload) can utilize the\n<code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to accurately generate Service Level Indicators\n(SLIs). Certain operators or controllers that manage underlying pods may utilize\nthe <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to optimize the set of actions performed when pods\nrepeatedly fail to come up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-is-this-different-from-the-existing-initialized-condition-reported-for-pods\">How is this different from the existing Initialized condition reported for pods?</h3>\n<p>The kubelet sets the status of the existing <code>Initialized</code> condition reported in\nthe status field of a pod depending on the presence of init containers in a pod.</p>\n<p>If a pod specifies init containers, the status of the <code>Initialized</code> condition in\nthe pod status will not be set to <code>True</code> until all init containers for the pod\nhave succeeded. However, init containers, configured by users, may have errors\n(payload crashing, invalid image, etc) and the number of init containers\nconfigured in a pod may vary across different workloads. Therefore,\ncluster-wide, infrastructural SLIs around pod initialization cannot depend on\nthe <code>Initialized</code> condition of pods.</p>\n<p>If a pod does not specify init containers, the status of the <code>Initialized</code>\ncondition in the pod status is set to <code>True</code> very early in the lifecycle of the\npod. This occurs before the kubelet initiates any pod runtime sandbox creation\nand network configuration steps. As a result, a pod without init containers will\nreport the status of the <code>Initialized</code> condition as <code>True</code> even if the container\nruntime is not able to successfully initialize the pod sandbox environment.</p>\n<p>Relative to either situation above, the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition surfaces more\naccurate data around when the pod runtime sandbox was initialized with\nnetworking configured so that the kubelet can proceed to launch user-configured\ncontainers (including init containers) in the pod.</p>\n<p>Note that a node agent may dynamically re-configure network interface(s) for a\npod by watching changes in pod annotations that specify additional networking\nconfiguration (e.g. <code>k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks</code>). Dynamic updates of pod\nnetworking configuration after the pod sandbox is initialized by Kubelet (in\ncoordination with a container runtime) are not reflected by the <code>PodHasNetwork</code>\ncondition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"try-out-the-podhasnetwork-condition-for-pods\">Try out the PodHasNetwork condition for pods</h3>\n<p>In order to have the kubelet report the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition in the status\nfield of a pod, please enable the <code>PodHasNetworkCondition</code> feature gate on the\nkubelet.</p>\n<p>For a pod whose runtime sandbox has been successfully created and has networking\nconfigured, the kubelet will report the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition with status set to <code>True</code>:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>$ kubectl describe pod nginx1\nName: nginx1\nNamespace: default\n...\nConditions:\nType Status\nPodHasNetwork True\nInitialized True\nReady True\nContainersReady True\nPodScheduled True\n</code></pre><p>For a pod whose runtime sandbox has not been created yet (and networking not\nconfigured either), the kubelet will report the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition with\nstatus set to <code>False</code>:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>$ kubectl describe pod nginx2\nName: nginx2\nNamespace: default\n...\nConditions:\nType Status\nPodHasNetwork False\nInitialized True\nReady False\nContainersReady False\nPodScheduled True\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h3>\n<p>Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes team plans to push the\nreporting of the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to Beta in 1.26 or 1.27.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn more?</h3>\n<p>Please check out the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/\">documentation</a> for the\n<code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to learn more about it and how it fits in relation to\nother pod conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-get-involved\">How to get involved?</h3>\n<p>This feature is driven by the SIG Node community.
