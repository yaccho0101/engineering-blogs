HostProcess containers run\ndirectly on the host and maintain behavior and access similar to that of a regular\nprocess. With HostProcess containers, users can package and distribute management\noperations and functionalities that require host access while retaining versioning\nand deployment methods provided by containers. This allows Windows containers to\nbe used for a variety of device plugin, storage, and networking management scenarios\nin Kubernetes. With this comes the enablement of host network mode—allowing\nHostProcess containers to be created within the host's network namespace instead of\ntheir own. HostProcess containers can also be built on top of existing Windows server\n2019 (or later) base images, managed through the Windows container runtime, and run\nas any user that is available on or in the domain of the host machine.</p>\n<p>Linux privileged containers are currently used for a variety of key scenarios in\nKubernetes, including kube-proxy (via kubeadm), storage, and networking scenarios.\nSupport for these scenarios in Windows previously required workarounds via proxies\nor other implementations. Using HostProcess containers, cluster operators no longer\nneed to log onto and individually configure each Windows node for administrative\ntasks and management of Windows services. Operators can now utilize the container\nmodel to deploy management logic to as many clusters as needed with ease.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>Windows HostProcess containers are implemented with Windows <em>Job Objects</em>, a break from the\nprevious container model using server silos. Job objects are components of the Windows OS which offer the ability to\nmanage a group of processes as a group (a.k.a. <em>jobs</em>) and assign resource constraints to the\ngroup as a whole. Job objects are specific to the Windows OS and are not associated with the Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Job API</a>. They have no process or file system isolation,\nenabling the privileged payload to view and edit the host file system with the\ncorrect permissions, among other host resources. The init process, and any processes\nit launches or that are explicitly launched by the user, are all assigned to the\njob object of that container. When the init process exits or is signaled to exit,\nall the processes in the job will be signaled to exit, the job handle will be\nclosed and the storage will be unmounted.</p>\n<p>HostProcess and Linux privileged containers enable similar scenarios but differ\ngreatly in their implementation (hence the naming difference). HostProcess containers\nhave their own pod security policies. Those used to configure Linux privileged\ncontainers <strong>do not</strong> apply. Enabling privileged access to a Windows host is a\nfundamentally different process than with Linux so the configuration and\ncapabilities of each differ significantly. Below is a diagram detailing the\noverall architecture of Windows HostProcess containers:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/16/windows-hostprocess-containers/hostprocess-architecture.png\"\nalt=\"HostProcess Architecture\"/>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>HostProcess containers can be run from within a\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/create-hostprocess-pod\">HostProcess Pod</a>.\nWith the feature enabled on Kubernetes version 1.22, a containerd container runtime of\n1.5.4 or higher, and the latest version of hcsshim, deploying a pod spec with the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/create-hostprocess-pod/#before-you-begin\">correct HostProcess configuration</a>\nwill enable you to run HostProcess containers.

In that case, you'll know about the potential for extra latency when\ncompute resources need to access memory on the different NUMA locality.</p>\n<p>To get the best performance and latency for your workload, container CPUs,\nperipheral devices, and memory should all be aligned to the same NUMA\nlocality.\nBefore Kubernetes v1.22, the kubelet already provided a set of managers to\nalign CPUs and PCI devices, but you did not have a way to align memory.\nThe Linux kernel was able to make best-effort attempts to allocate\nmemory for tasks from the same NUMA node where the container is\nexecuting are placed, but without any guarantee about that placement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>The memory manager is doing two main things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provides the topology hint to the Topology Manager</li>\n<li>allocates the memory for containers and updates the state</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The overall sequence of the Memory Manager under the Kubelet</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2021-08-11-memory-manager-moves-to-beta/MemoryManagerDiagram.svg\" alt=\"MemoryManagerDiagram\" title=\"MemoryManagerDiagram\"></p>\n<p>During the Admission phase:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When first handling a new pod, the kubelet calls the TopologyManager's <code>Admit()</code> method.</li>\n<li>The Topology Manager is calling <code>GetTopologyHints()</code> for every hint provider including the Memory Manager.</li>\n<li>The Memory Manager calculates all possible NUMA nodes combinations for every container inside the pod and returns hints to the Topology Manager.</li>\n<li>The Topology Manager calls to <code>Allocate()</code> for every hint provider including the Memory Manager.</li>\n<li>The Memory Manager allocates the memory under the state according to the hint that the Topology Manager chose.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>During Pod creation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The kubelet calls <code>PreCreateContainer()</code>.</li>\n<li>For each container, the Memory Manager looks the NUMA nodes where it allocated the\nmemory for the container and then returns that information to the kubelet.</li>\n<li>The kubelet creates the container, via CRI, using a container specification\nthat incorporates information from the Memory Manager information.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"let-s-talk-about-the-configuration\">Let's talk about the configuration</h3>\n<p>By default, the Memory Manager runs with the <code>None</code> policy, meaning it will just\nrelax and not do anything. To make use of the Memory Manager, you should set\ntwo command line options for the kubelet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--memory-manager-policy=Static</code></li>\n<li><code>--reserved-memory=&quot;&lt;numaNodeID&gt;:&lt;resourceName&gt;=&lt;quantity&gt;&quot;</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The value for <code>--memory-manager-policy</code> is straightforward: <code>Static</code>. Deciding what to specify for <code>--reserved-memory</code> takes more thought. To configure it correctly, you should follow two main rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The amount of reserved memory for the <code>memory</code> resource must be greater than zero.</li>\n<li>The amount of reserved memory for the resource type must be equal\nto <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable\">NodeAllocatable</a>\n(<code>kube-reserved + system-reserved + eviction-hard</code>) for the resource.\nYou can read more about memory reservations in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/\">Reserve Compute Resources for System Daemons</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2021-08-11-memory-manager-moves-to-beta/ReservedMemory.svg\" alt=\"Reserved memory\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"current-limitations\">Current limitations</h2>\n<p>The 1.22 release and promotion to beta brings along enhancements and fixes, but the Memory Manager still has several limitations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"single-vs-cross-numa-node-allocation\">Single vs Cross NUMA node allocation</h3>\n<p>The NUMA node can not have both single and cross NUMA node allocations. When the container memory is pinned to two or more NUMA nodes, we can not know from which NUMA node the container will consume the memory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2021-08-11-memory-manager-moves-to-beta/SingleCrossNUMAAllocation.svg\" alt=\"Single vs Cross NUMA allocation\" title=\"SingleCrossNUMAAllocation\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <code>container1</code> started on the NUMA node 0 and requests <em>5Gi</em> of the memory but currently is consuming only <em>3Gi</em> of the memory.</li>\n<li>For container2 the memory request is 10Gi, and no single NUMA node can satisfy it.</li>\n<li>The <code>container2</code> consumes <em>3.5Gi</em> of the memory from the NUMA node 0, but once the <code>container1</code> will require more memory, it will not have it, and the kernel will kill one of the containers with the <em>OOM</em> error.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To prevent such issues, the Memory Manager will fail the admission of the <code>container2</code> until the machine has two NUMA nodes without a single NUMA node allocation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"works-only-for-guaranteed-pods\">Works only for Guaranteed pods</h3>\n<p>The Memory Manager can not guarantee memory allocation for Burstable pods,\nalso when the Burstable pod has specified equal memory limit and request.</p>\n<p>Let's assume you have two Burstable pods: <code>pod1</code> has containers with\nequal memory request and limits, and <code>pod2</code> has containers only with a\nmemory request set. You want to guarantee memory allocation for the <code>pod1</code>.\nTo the Linux kernel, processes in either pod have the same <em>OOM score</em>,\nonce the kernel finds that it does not have enough memory, it can kill\nprocesses that belong to pod <code>pod1</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-fragmentation\">Memory fragmentation</h3>\n<p>The sequence of Pods and containers that start and stop can fragment the memory on NUMA nodes.\nThe alpha implementation of the Memory Manager does not have any mechanism to balance pods and defragment memory back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-work-for-the-memory-manager\">Future work for the Memory Manager</h2>\n<p>We do not want to stop with the current state of the Memory Manager and are looking to\nmake improvements, including in the following areas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"make-the-memory-manager-allocation-algorithm-smarter\">Make the Memory Manager allocation algorithm smarter</h3>\n<p>The current algorithm ignores distances between NUMA nodes during the\ncalculation of the allocation. If same-node placement isn't available, we can still\nprovide better performance compared to the current implementation, by changing the\nMemory Manager to prefer the closest NUMA nodes for cross-node allocation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reduce-the-number-of-admission-errors\">Reduce the number of admission errors</h3>\n<p>The default Kubernetes scheduler is not aware of the node's NUMA topology, and it can be a reason for many admission errors during the pod start.\nWe're hoping to add a KEP (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal) to cover improvements in this area.\nFollow <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2044\">Topology aware scheduler plugin in kube-scheduler</a> to see how this idea progresses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With the promotion of the Memory Manager to beta in 1.22, we encourage everyone to give it a try and look forward to any feedback you may have. While there are still several limitations, we have a set of enhancements planned to address them and look forward to providing you with many new features in upcoming releases.\nIf you have ideas for additional enhancements or a desire for certain features, please let us know.
