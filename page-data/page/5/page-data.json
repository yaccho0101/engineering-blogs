Kubernetes 1.28 lifted that restriction, after some design changes were\ndone in 1.27.</p>\n<p>The beauty of this feature is that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is trivial to adopt (you just need to set a bool in the pod spec)</li>\n<li>doesn't need any changes for <strong>most</strong> applications</li>\n<li>improves security by <em>drastically</em> enhancing the isolation of containers and\nmitigating CVEs rated HIGH and CRITICAL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This post explains the basics of user namespaces and also shows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the changes that arrived in the recent Kubernetes v1.28 release</li>\n<li>a <strong>demo of a vulnerability rated as HIGH</strong> that is not exploitable with user namespaces</li>\n<li>the runtime requirements to use this feature</li>\n<li>what you can expect in future releases regarding user namespaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-user-namespace\">What is a user namespace?</h2>\n<p>A user namespace is a Linux feature that isolates the user and group identifiers\n(UIDs and GIDs) of the containers from the ones on the host. The indentifiers\nin the container can be mapped to indentifiers on the host in a way where the\nhost UID/GIDs used for different containers never overlap. Even more, the\nidentifiers can be mapped to <em>unprivileged</em> non-overlapping UIDs and GIDs on the\nhost. This basically means two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As the UIDs and GIDs for different containers are mapped to different UIDs\nand GIDs on the host, containers have a harder time to attack each other even\nif they escape the container boundaries. For example, if container A is running\nwith different UIDs and GIDs on the host than container B, the operations it\ncan do on container B's files and process are limited: only read/write what a\nfile allows to others, as it will never have permission for the owner or\ngroup (the UIDs/GIDs on the host are guaranteed to be different for\ndifferent containers).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As the UIDs and GIDs are mapped to unprivileged users on the host, if a\ncontainer escapes the container boundaries, even if it is running as root\ninside the container, it has no privileges on the host. This greatly\nprotects what host files it can read/write, which process it can send signals\nto, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, capabilities granted are only valid inside the user namespace and\nnot on the host.</p>\n<p>Without using a user namespace a container running as root, in the case of a\ncontainer breakout, has root privileges on the node. And if some capabilities\nwere granted to the container, the capabilities are valid on the host too. None\nof this is true when using user namespaces (modulo bugs, of course 🙂).</p>\n<h2 id=\"changes-in-1-28\">Changes in 1.28</h2>\n<p>As already mentioned, starting from 1.28, Kubernetes supports user namespaces\nwith stateful pods. This means that pods with user namespaces can use any type\nof volume, they are no longer limited to only some volume types as before.</p>\n<p>The feature gate to activate this feature was renamed, it is no longer\n<code>UserNamespacesStatelessPodsSupport</code> but from 1.28 onwards you should use\n<code>UserNamespacesSupport</code>. There were many changes done and the requirements on\nthe node hosts changed. So with Kubernetes 1.28 the feature flag was renamed to\nreflect this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"demo\">Demo</h2>\n<p>Rodrigo created a demo which exploits <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2022-0492-cgroups/\">CVE 2022-0492</a> and shows how\nthe exploit can occur without user namespaces. He also shows how it is not\npossible to use this exploit from a Pod where the containers are using this\nfeature.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is rated <strong>HIGH</strong> and allows <strong>a container with no special\nprivileges to read/write to any path on the host</strong> and launch processes as root\non the host too.</p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M4a2b4KkXN8\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"Mitigation of CVE-2022-0492 on Kubernetes by enabling User Namespace support\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Most applications in containers run as root today, or as a semi-predictable\nnon-root user (user ID 65534 is a somewhat popular choice). When you run a Pod\nwith containers using a userns, Kubernetes runs those containers as unprivileged\nusers, with no changes needed in your app.</p>\n<p>This means two containers running as user 65534 will effectively be mapped to\ndifferent users on the host, limiting what they can do to each other in case of\nan escape, and if they are running as root, the privileges on the host are\nreduced to the one of an unprivileged user.</p>\n<h2 id=\"node-system-requirements\">Node system requirements</h2>\n<p>There are requirements on the Linux kernel version as well as the container\nruntime to use this feature.</p>\n<p>On Linux you need Linux 6.3 or greater. This is because the feature relies on a\nkernel feature named idmap mounts, and support to use idmap mounts with tmpfs\nwas merged in Linux 6.3.</p>\n<p>If you are using CRI-O with crun, this is <a href=\"https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/releases/tag/v1.28.1\">supported in CRI-O\n1.28.1</a> and crun 1.9 or greater. If you are using CRI-O with runc,\nthis is still not supported.</p>\n<p>containerd support is currently targeted for containerd 2.0; it is likely that\nit won't matter if you use it with crun or runc.</p>\n<p>Please note that containerd 1.7 added <em>experimental</em> support for user\nnamespaces as implemented in Kubernetes 1.25 and 1.26. The redesign done in 1.27\nis not supported by containerd 1.7, therefore it only works, in terms of user\nnamespaces support, with Kubernetes 1.25 and 1.26.</p>\n<p>One limitation present in containerd 1.7 is that it needs to change the\nownership of every file and directory inside the container image, during Pod\nstartup. This means it has a storage overhead and can significantly impact the\ncontainer startup latency. Containerd 2.0 will probably include a implementation\nthat will eliminate the startup latency added and the storage overhead. Take\nthis into account if you plan to use containerd 1.7 with user namespaces in\nproduction.</p>\n<p>None of these containerd limitations apply to <a href=\"https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/releases/tag/v1.28.1\">CRI-O 1.28</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead to Kubernetes 1.29, the plan is to work with SIG Auth to integrate user\nnamespaces to Pod Security Standards (PSS) and the Pod Security Admission. For\nthe time being, the plan is to relax checks in PSS policies when user namespaces are\nin use. This means that the fields <code>spec[.*].securityContext</code> <code>runAsUser</code>,\n<code>runAsNonRoot</code>, <code>allowPrivilegeEscalation</code> and <code>capabilities</code> will not trigger a\nviolation if user namespaces are in use. The behavior will probably be controlled by\nutilizing a API Server feature gate, like <code>UserNamespacesPodSecurityStandards</code>\nor similar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-involved\">How do I get involved?</h2>\n<p>You can reach SIG Node by several means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slack: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-node\">#sig-node</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-node\">Mailing list</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/labels/sig%2Fnode\">Open Community Issues/PRs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also contact us directly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitHub: @rata @giuseppe @saschagrunert</li>\n<li>Slack: @rata @giuseppe @sascha</li>\n</ul>","PublishedAt":"2023-09-13 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/09/13/userns-alpha/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":4579,"Title":"Elastic Cloud is now available on Amazon Web Services (Stockholm)","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-09-13 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-cloud-now-available-aws-europe-north","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4580,"Title":"Introducing query rules in Elasticsearch 8.10","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-09-13 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-query-rules-elasticsearch-8-10","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4581,"Title":"Elastic Cloud is now available on Europe West 9 (Paris) and Asia Pacific Southeast 2 (Jakarta)","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-09-13 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-cloud-now-available-new-google-cloud-regions","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4585,"Title":"WASI support in Go","Description":"Go 1.21 adds a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API","PublishedAt":"2023-09-13 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://go.dev/blog/wasi","SourceName":"The Go Blog"}},{"node":{"ID":4586,"Title":"Monitor the health of your Temporal Server with Datadog","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/temporal-server-integration/temporal-server-integration-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Temporal is an open source programming model that enables users to write and run scalable and reliable cloud applications.
