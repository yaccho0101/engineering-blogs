For that reason, we have established and grown an engineering team that is specialized in providing the best possible streaming experience to our users across multiple platforms. To do this, we combine the industry’s best-fitting solutions with our own custom technologies, libraries, and tools. In this article, let’s dive into how we improved latency in our Android application by leveraging a new engine for our player’s audio sink.","PublishedAt":"2019-06-21 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/soundcloud-is-playing-the-oboe","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":819,"Title":"Alerting on SLOs like Pros","Description":"If there is anything like a silver bullet for creating meaningful and actionable alerts with a high signal-to-noise ratio, it is alerting based on service-level objectives (SLOs). Fulfilling a well-defined SLO is the very definition of meeting your users’ expectations. Conversely, a certain level of service errors is OK as long as you stay within the SLO — in other words, if the SLO grants you an error budget. Burning through this error budget too quickly is the ultimate signal that some rectifying action is needed. The faster the budget is burned, the more urgent it is that engineers get involved. This post describes how we implemented this concept at SoundCloud, enabling us to fulfill our SLOs without flooding our engineers on call with an unsustainable amount of pages.","PublishedAt":"2019-06-04 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/alerting-on-slos","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":281,"Title":"Who is GIPHY Engineering?","Description":"As GIPHY Engineering continues to grow, we thought it was important to take a step back and have a conversation about what it means to be a GIPHY Engineer.

Altogether, this process took up to one week, though there was even one scenario where it almost took one month to roll out a bug fix.
