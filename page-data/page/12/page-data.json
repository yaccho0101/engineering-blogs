In this blog post, we'll be shining a spotlight on the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md\">Special Interest Group for Contributor\nExperience</a>\n(SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project.</p>\n<p>SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and\nmaintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the\nproject. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may\nhinder the project's growth and feature velocity, such as pull request\nlatency and the number of open pull requests and issues.</p>\n<p>SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by\ncreating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that\nfacilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They\nalso focus on community building and support, including outreach\nprograms and mentorship initiatives to onboard and retain new\ncontributors.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the role of SIG ContribEx is to foster a welcoming and\ninclusive environment that encourages contribution and supports the\nlong-term sustainability of the Kubernetes project.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1fyka\">Fyka Ansari</a> interviews\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaslinfields\">Kaslin Fields</a>, a DevRel Engineer\nat Google, who is a chair of SIG ContribEx, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MadhavJivrajani\">Madhav\nJivrajani</a>, a Software Engineer\nat VMWare who serves as a SIG ContribEx Tech Lead. This interview\ncovers various aspects of SIG ContribEx, including current\ninitiatives, exciting developments, and how interested individuals can\nget involved and contribute to the group. It provides valuable\ninsights into the workings of SIG ContribEx and highlights the\nimportance of its role in the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introductions\">Introductions</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> Let's start by diving into your background and how you got\ninvolved in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Can you tell us more about that\njourney?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> I first got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem through\nmy mentor, Jonathan Rippy, who introduced me to containers during my\nearly days in tech. Eventually, I transitioned to a team working with\ncontainers, which sparked my interest in Kubernetes when it was\nannounced. While researching Kubernetes in that role, I eagerly sought\nopportunities to engage with the containers/Kubernetes community. It\nwas not until my subsequent job that I found a suitable role to\ncontribute consistently. I joined SIG ContribEx, specifically in the\nContributor Comms subproject, to both deepen my knowledge of\nKubernetes and support the community better.</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> My journey with Kubernetes began when I was a student,\nsearching for interesting and exciting projects to work on. With my\npeers, I discovered open source and attended The New Contributor\nWorkshop organized by the Kubernetes community. The workshop not only\nprovided valuable insights into the community structure but also gave\nme a sense of warmth and welcome, which motivated me to join and\nremain involved. I realized that collaboration is at the heart of\nopen-source communities, and to get answers and support, I needed to\ncontribute and do my part. I started working on issues in ContribEx,\nparticularly focusing on GitHub automation, despite not fully\nunderstanding the task at first. I continued to contribute for various\ntechnical and non-technical aspects of the project, finding it to be\none of the most professionally rewarding experiences in my life.</p>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> That's such an inspiration in itself! I'm sure beginners who\nare reading this got the ultimate motivation to take their first\nsteps. Embracing the Learning journey, seeking mentorship, and\nengaging with the Kubernetes community can pave the way for exciting\nopportunities in the tech industry. Your stories proved the importance\nof starting small and being proactive, just like Madhav said Don't be\nafraid to take on tasks, even if you're uncertain at first.</p>\n<h3 id=\"primary-goals-and-scope\">Primary goals and scope</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> Given your experience as a member of SIG ContribEx, could\nyou tell us a bit about the group's primary goals and initiatives? Its\ncurrent focus areas? What do you see as the scope of SIG ContribEx and\nthe impact it has on the Kubernetes community?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> SIG ContribEx's primary goals are to simplify the\ncontributions of Kubernetes contributors and foster a welcoming\ncommunity. It collaborates with other Kubernetes SIGs, such as\nplanning the Contributor Summit at KubeCon, ensuring it meets the\nneeds of various groups. The group's impact is evident in projects\nlike updating org membership policies and managing critical platforms\nlike Zoom, YouTube, and Slack. Its scope encompasses making the\ncontributor experience smoother and supporting the overall Kubernetes\ncommunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> The Kubernetes project has vertical SIGs and cross-cutting\nSIGs, ContribEx is a deeply cross-cutting SIG, impacting virtually\nevery area of the Kubernetes community. Adding to Kaslin,\nsustainability in the Kubernetes project and community is critical now\nmore than ever, it plays a central role in addressing critical issues,\nsuch as maintainer succession, by facilitating cohorts for SIGs to\ntrain experienced community members to take on leadership\nroles. Excellent examples include SIG CLI and SIG Apps, leading to the\nonboarding of new reviewers. Additionally, SIG ContribEx is essential\nin managing GitHub automation tools, including bots and commands used\nby contributors for interacting with <a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a>\nand other automation (label syncing, group and GitHub team management,\netc).</p>\n<h3 id=\"beginner-s-guide\">Beginner's guide!</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> I'll never forget talking to Kaslin when I joined the\ncommunity and needed help with contributing. Kaslin, your quick and\nclear answers were a huge help in getting me started. Can you both\ngive some tips for people new to contributing to Kubernetes? What\nmakes SIG ContribEx a great starting point? Why should beginners and\ncurrent contributors consider it? And what cool opportunities are\nthere for newbies to jump in?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> If you want to contribute to Kubernetes for the first\ntime, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. A good option is\nto join SIG ContribEx as it offers great opportunities to know and\nserve the community. Within SIG ContribEx, various subprojects allow\nyou to explore different parts of the Kubernetes project while you\nlearn how contributions work. Once you know a bit more, it’s common\nfor you to move to other SIGs within the project, and we think that’s\nwonderful. While many newcomers look for &quot;good first issues&quot; to start\nwith, these opportunities can be scarce and get claimed\nquickly. Instead, the real benefit lies in attending meetings and\ngetting to know the community. As you learn more about the project and\nthe people involved, you'll be better equipped to offer your help, and\nthe community will be more inclined to seek your assistance when\nneeded. As a co-lead for the Contributor Comms subproject, I can\nconfidently say that it's an excellent place for beginners to get\ninvolved. We have supportive leads and particularly beginner-friendly\nprojects too.</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> To begin, read the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master#readme\">SIG\nREADME</a> on\nGitHub, which provides an overview of the projects the SIG\nmanages. While attending meetings is beneficial for all SIGs, it's\nespecially recommended for SIG ContribEx, as each subproject gets\ndedicated slots for updates and areas that need help. If you can't\nattend in real-time due to time zone differences, you can catch the\nmeeting recordings or\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K3vjCZ9C3LwYrOJOhztQtFuDQCe-urv-ewx1bI8IPVQ/edit?usp=sharing\">Notes</a>\nlater.</p>\n<h3 id=\"skills-you-learn\">Skills you learn!</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> What skills do you look for when bringing in new\ncontributors to SIG ContribEx, from passion to expertise?\nAdditionally, what skills can contributors expect to develop while\nworking with SIG ContribEx?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> Skills folks need to have or will acquire vary depending\non what area of ContribEx they work upon. Even within a subproject, a\nrange of skills can be useful and/or developed. For example, the tech\nlead role involves technical tasks and overseeing automation, while\nthe social media lead role requires excellent communication\nskills. Working with SIG ContribEx allows contributors to acquire\nvarious skills based on their chosen subproject. By participating in\nmeetings, listening, learning, and taking on tasks related to their\ninterests, they can develop and hone these skills. Some subprojects\nmay require more specialized skills, like program management for the\nmentoring project, but all contributors can benefit from offering\ntheir talents to help teach others and contribute to the community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sub-projects-under-sig-contribex\">Sub-projects under SIG ContribEx</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> SIG ContribEx has several smaller projects. Can you tell me\nabout the aims of these projects and how they've impacted the\nKubernetes community?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> Some SIGs have one or two subprojects and some have none\nat all, but in SIG ContribEx, we have ELEVEN!</p>\n<p>Here’s a list of them and their respective mission statements</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Community</strong>: Manages the community repository, documentation,\nand operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Community management</strong>: Handles communication platforms and\npolicies for the community.</li>\n<li><strong>Contributor-comms</strong>: Focuses on promoting the success of\nKubernetes contributors through marketing.</li>\n<li><strong>Contributors-documentation</strong>: Writes and maintains documentation\nfor contributing to Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><strong>Devstats</strong>: Maintains and updates the <a href=\"https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io\">Kubernetes\nstatistics</a> website.</li>\n<li><strong>Elections</strong>: Oversees community elections and maintains related\ndocumentation and software.</li>\n<li><strong>Events</strong>: Organizes contributor-focused events like the\nContributor Summit.</li>\n<li><strong>Github management</strong>: Manages permissions, repositories, and\ngroups on GitHub.</li>\n<li><strong>Mentoring</strong>: Develop programs to help contributors progress in\ntheir contributions.</li>\n<li><strong>Sigs-GitHub-actions</strong>: Repository for GitHub actions related to\nall SIGs in Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><strong>Slack-infra</strong>: Creates and maintains tools and automation for\nKubernetes Slack.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> Also, Devstats is critical from a sustainability\nstandpoint!</p>\n<p><em>(If you are willing to learn more and get involved with any of these\nsub-projects, check out the</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md#subprojects\">SIG ContribEx\nREADME</a>)._</p>\n<h3 id=\"accomplishments\">Accomplishments</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> With that said, any SIG-related accomplishment that you’re\nproud of?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> I'm proud of the accomplishments made by SIG ContribEx and\nits contributors in supporting the community. Some of the recent\nachievements include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Establishment of the elections subproject</em>: Kubernetes is a massive\nproject, and ensuring smooth leadership transitions is\ncrucial. The contributors in this subproject organize fair and\nconsistent elections, which helps keep the project running\neffectively.</li>\n<li><em>New issue triage proces</em>: With such a large open-source project\nlike Kubernetes, there's always a lot of work to be done. To\nensure things progress safely, we implemented new labels and\nupdated functionality for issue triage using our PROW tool. This\nreduces bottlenecks in the workflow and allows leaders to\naccomplish more.</li>\n<li><em>New org membership requirements</em>: Becoming an org member in\nKubernetes can be overwhelming for newcomers. We view org\nmembership as a significant milestone for contributors aiming to\ntake on leadership roles. We recently updated the rules to\nautomatically remove privileges from inactive members, making sure\nthat the right people have access to the necessary tools and\nresponsibilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, these accomplishments have greatly benefited our fellow\ncontributors and strengthened the Kubernetes community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upcoming-initiatives\">Upcoming initiatives</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> Could you give us a sneak peek into what's next for the\ngroup? We're excited to hear about upcoming projects and initiatives\nfrom this dynamic team.</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> We’d love for more groups to sign up for mentoring\ncohorts! We’re probably going to have to spend some time polishing the\nprocess around that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> As we wrap up our conversation, would you like to share some\nfinal thoughts for those interested in contributing to SIG ContribEx\nor getting involved with Kubernetes?</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav</strong>: Kubernetes is meant to be overwhelming and difficult\ninitially! You’re coming into something that’s taken multiple people,\nfrom multiple countries, multiple years to build. Embrace that\ndiversity! Use the high entropy initially to collide around and gain\nas much knowledge about the project and community as possible before\nyou decide to settle in your niche.</p>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> Thank You Madhav and Kaslin, it was an absolute pleasure\nchatting about SIG ContribEx and your experiences as a member. It's\nclear that the role of SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is significant and\nessential, ensuring scalability, growth and productivity, and I hope\nthis interview inspires more people to get involved and contribute to\nKubernetes. I wish SIG ContribEx all the best, and can't wait to see\nwhat exciting things lie ahead!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-next\">What next?</h2>\n<p>We love meeting new contributors and helping them in investigating\ndifferent Kubernetes project spaces.
