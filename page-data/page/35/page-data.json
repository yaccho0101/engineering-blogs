KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to\nperform this encryption.</p>\n<p>KMS v1 has been a feature of Kubernetes since version 1.10, and is currently in beta as of version\nv1.12. KMS v2 was introduced as alpha in v1.25.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Note</h4>\nThe KMS v2 API and implementation changed in incompatible\nways in-between the alpha release in v1.25 and the beta release in v1.27. The design of KMS v2 has\nchanged since <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/09/kms-v2-improvements/\">the previous blog post</a>\nwas written and it is not compatible with the design in this blog post. Attempting to upgrade from\nold versions with the alpha feature enabled will result in data loss.\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-v2beta1\">What’s new in <code>v2beta1</code>?</h2>\n<p>The KMS encryption provider uses an envelope encryption scheme to encrypt data in etcd. The data is\nencrypted using a data encryption key (DEK). The DEKs are encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK)\nthat is stored and managed in a remote KMS. With KMS v1, a new DEK is generated for each encryption.\nWith KMS v2, a new DEK is only generated on server startup and when the KMS plugin informs the API\nserver that a KEK rotation has occurred.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\n<h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Caution</h4>\n<p>If you are running virtual machine (VM) based nodes\nthat leverage VM state store with this feature, you must not use KMS v2.</p>\n<p>With KMS v2, the API server uses AES-GCM with a 12 byte nonce (8 byte atomic counter and 4 bytes\nrandom data) for encryption. The following issues could occur if the VM is saved and restored:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The counter value may be lost or corrupted if the VM is saved in an inconsistent state or\nrestored improperly. This can lead to a situation where the same counter value is used twice,\nresulting in the same nonce being used for two different messages.</li>\n<li>If the VM is restored to a previous state, the counter value may be set back to its previous\nvalue, resulting in the same nonce being used again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although both of these cases are partially mitigated by the 4 byte random nonce, this can compromise\nthe security of the encryption.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"sequence-diagram\">Sequence Diagram</h3>\n<h4 id=\"encrypt-request\">Encrypt Request</h4>\n<!-- source\n```mermaid\n%%{init:{\"theme\":\"neutral\", \"sequence\": {\"mirrorActors\":true},\n\"themeVariables\": {\n\"actorBkg\":\"royalblue\",\n\"actorTextColor\":\"white\"\n}}}%%\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant user\nparticipant kube_api_server\nparticipant kms_plugin\nparticipant external_kms\nalt Generate DEK at startup\nNote over kube_api_server,external_kms: Refer to Generate Data Encryption Key (DEK) diagram for details\nend\nuser->>kube_api_server: create/update resource that's to be encrypted\nkube_api_server->>kube_api_server: encrypt resource with DEK\nkube_api_server->>etcd: store encrypted object\n```\n-->\n<figure class=\"diagram-large\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2023-05-16-kubernetes-1.27-kmsv2-beta/kubernetes-1.27-encryption.svg\"\nalt=\"Sequence diagram for KMSv2 beta Encrypt\"/>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"decrypt-request\">Decrypt Request</h4>\n<!-- source\n```mermaid\n%%{init:{\"theme\":\"neutral\", \"sequence\": {\"mirrorActors\":true},\n\"themeVariables\": {\n\"actorBkg\":\"royalblue\",\n\"actorTextColor\":\"white\"\n}}}%%\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant user\nparticipant kube_api_server\nparticipant kms_plugin\nparticipant external_kms\nparticipant etcd\nuser->>kube_api_server: get/list resource that's encrypted\nkube_api_server->>etcd: get encrypted resource\netcd->>kube_api_server: encrypted resource\nalt Encrypted DEK not in cache\nkube_api_server->>kms_plugin: decrypt request\nkms_plugin->>external_kms: decrypt DEK with remote KEK\nexternal_kms->>kms_plugin: decrypted DEK\nkms_plugin->>kube_api_server: return decrypted DEK\nkube_api_server->>kube_api_server: cache decrypted DEK\nend\nkube_api_server->>kube_api_server: decrypt resource with DEK\nkube_api_server->>user: return decrypted resource\n```\n-->\n<figure class=\"diagram-large\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2023-05-16-kubernetes-1.27-kmsv2-beta/kubernetes-1.27-decryption.svg\"\nalt=\"Sequence diagram for KMSv2 beta Decrypt\"/>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"status-request\">Status Request</h4>\n<!-- source\n```mermaid\n%%{init:{\"theme\":\"neutral\", \"sequence\": {\"mirrorActors\":true},\n\"themeVariables\": {\n\"actorBkg\":\"royalblue\",\n\"actorTextColor\":\"white\"\n}}}%%\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant kube_api_server\nparticipant kms_plugin\nparticipant external_kms\nalt Generate DEK at startup\nNote over kube_api_server,external_kms: Refer to Generate Data Encryption Key (DEK) diagram for details\nend\nloop every minute (or every 10s if error or unhealthy)\nkube_api_server->>kms_plugin: status request\nkms_plugin->>external_kms: validate remote KEK\nexternal_kms->>kms_plugin: KEK status\nkms_plugin->>kube_api_server: return status response <br/> {\"healthz\": \"ok\", key_id: \"<remote KEK ID>\", \"version\": \"v2beta1\"}\nalt KEK rotation detected (key_id changed), rotate DEK\nNote over kube_api_server,external_kms: Refer to Generate Data Encryption Key (DEK) diagram for details\nend\nend\n```\n-->\n<figure class=\"diagram-large\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2023-05-16-kubernetes-1.27-kmsv2-beta/kubernetes-1.27-status.svg\"\nalt=\"Sequence diagram for KMSv2 beta Status\"/>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"generate-data-encryption-key-dek\">Generate Data Encryption Key (DEK)</h4>\n<!-- source\n```mermaid\n%%{init:{\"theme\":\"neutral\", \"sequence\": {\"mirrorActors\":true},\n\"themeVariables\": {\n\"actorBkg\":\"royalblue\",\n\"actorTextColor\":\"white\"\n}}}%%\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant kube_api_server\nparticipant kms_plugin\nparticipant external_kms\nkube_api_server->>kube_api_server: generate DEK\nkube_api_server->>kms_plugin: encrypt request\nkms_plugin->>external_kms: encrypt DEK with remote KEK\nexternal_kms->>kms_plugin: encrypted DEK\nkms_plugin->>kube_api_server: return encrypt response <br/> {\"ciphertext\": \"<encrypted DEK>\", key_id: \"<remote KEK ID>\", \"annotations\": {}}\n```\n-->\n<figure class=\"diagram-large\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2023-05-16-kubernetes-1.27-kmsv2-beta/kubernetes-1.27-generate-dek.svg\"\nalt=\"Sequence diagram for KMSv2 beta Generate DEK\"/>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"performance-improvements\">Performance Improvements</h3>\n<p>With KMS v2, we have made significant improvements to the performance of the KMS encryption\nprovider. In case of KMS v1, a new DEK is generated for every encryption. This means that for every\nwrite request, the API server makes a call to the KMS plugin to encrypt the DEK using the remote\nKEK. The API server also has to cache the DEKs to avoid making a call to the KMS plugin for every\nread request. When the API server restarts, it has to populate the cache by making a call to the KMS\nplugin for every DEK in the etcd store based on the cache size. This is a significant overhead for\nthe API server. With KMS v2, the API server generates a DEK at startup and caches it. The API server\nalso makes a call to the KMS plugin to encrypt the DEK using the remote KEK. This is a one-time call\nat startup and on KEK rotation. The API server then uses the cached DEK to encrypt the resources.\nThis reduces the number of calls to the KMS plugin and improves the overall latency of the API\nserver requests.</p>\n<p>We conducted a test that created 12k secrets and measured the time taken for the API server to\nencrypt the resources. The metric used was\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/metrics/\"><code>apiserver_storage_transformation_duration_seconds</code></a>.\nFor KMS v1, the test was run on a managed Kubernetes v1.25 cluster with 2 nodes. There was no\nadditional load on the cluster during the test. For KMS v2, the test was run in the Kubernetes CI\nenvironment with the following <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.27/test/e2e/testing-manifests/auth/encrypt/kind.yaml\">cluster\nconfiguration</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>KMS Provider</th>\n<th>Time taken by 95 percentile</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>KMS v1</td>\n<td>160ms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KMS v2</td>\n<td>80μs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The results show that the KMS v2 encryption provider is three orders of magnitude faster than the\nKMS v1 encryption provider.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>For Kubernetes v1.28, we expect the feature to stay in beta. In the coming releases we want to\ninvestigate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cryptographic changes to remove the limitation on VM state store.</li>\n<li>Kubernetes REST API changes to enable a more robust story around key rotation.</li>\n<li>Handling undecryptable resources.

This is a common issue that\ncluster administrators may face.</p>\n<p>This blog post focuses on methods to speed up pod start-up from the kubelet side. It does not\ninvolve the creation time of pods by controller-manager through kube-apiserver, nor does it\ninclude scheduling time for pods or webhooks executed on it.</p>\n<p>We have mentioned some important factors here to consider from the kubelet's perspective, but\nthis is not an exhaustive list. As Kubernetes v1.27 is released, this blog highlights\nsignificant changes in v1.27 that aid in speeding up pod start-up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"parallel-container-image-pulls\">Parallel container image pulls</h2>\n<p>Pulling images always takes some time and what's worse is that image pulls are done serially by\ndefault. In other words, kubelet will send only one image pull request to the image service at\na time. Other image pull requests have to wait until the one being processed is complete.</p>\n<p>To enable parallel image pulls, set the <code>serializeImagePulls</code> field to false in the kubelet\nconfiguration. When <code>serializeImagePulls</code> is disabled, requests for image pulls are immediately\nsent to the image service and multiple images can be pulled concurrently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximum-parallel-image-pulls-will-help-secure-your-node-from-overloading-on-image-pulling\">Maximum parallel image pulls will help secure your node from overloading on image pulling</h3>\n<p>We introduced a new feature in kubelet that sets a limit on the number of parallel image\npulls at the node level. This limit restricts the maximum number of images that can be pulled\nsimultaneously. If there is an image pull request beyond this limit, it will be blocked until\none of the ongoing image pulls finishes. Before enabling this feature, please ensure that your\ncontainer runtime's image service can handle parallel image pulls effectively.</p>\n<p>To limit the number of simultaneous image pulls, you can configure the <code>maxParallelImagePulls</code>\nfield in kubelet. By setting <code>maxParallelImagePulls</code> to a value of <em>n</em>, only <em>n</em> images will\nbe pulled concurrently. Any additional image pulls beyond this limit will wait until at least\none ongoing pull is complete.</p>\n<p>You can find more details in the associated KEP: <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3673\">Kubelet limit of Parallel Image Pulls</a>\n(KEP-3673).</p>\n<h2 id=\"raised-default-api-query-per-second-limits-for-kubelet\">Raised default API query-per-second limits for kubelet</h2>\n<p>To improve pod startup in scenarios with multiple pods on a node, particularly sudden scaling\nsituations, it is necessary for Kubelet to synchronize the pod status and prepare configmaps,\nsecrets, or volumes. This requires a large bandwidth to access kube-apiserver.</p>\n<p>In versions prior to v1.27, the default <code>kubeAPIQPS</code> was 5 and <code>kubeAPIBurst</code> was 10. However,\nthe kubelet in v1.27 has increased these defaults to 50 and 100 respectively for better performance during\npod startup. It's worth noting that this isn't the only reason why we've bumped up the API QPS\nlimits for Kubelet.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It has a potential to be hugely throttled now (default QPS = 5)</li>\n<li>In large clusters they can generate significant load anyway as there are a lot of them</li>\n<li>They have a dedicated PriorityLevel and FlowSchema that we can easily control</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Previously, we often encountered <code>volume mount timeout</code> on kubelet in node with more than 50 pods\nduring pod start up. We suggest that cluster operators bump <code>kubeAPIQPS</code> to 20 and <code>kubeAPIBurst</code> to 40,\nespecially if using bare metal nodes.</p>\n<p>More detials can be found in the KEP <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1040\">https://kep.k8s.io/1040</a> and the pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116121\">#116121</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"event-triggered-updates-to-container-status\">Event triggered updates to container status</h2>\n<p><code>Evented PLEG</code> (PLEG is short for &quot;Pod Lifecycle Event Generator&quot;) is set to be in beta for v1.27,\nKubernetes offers two ways for the kubelet to detect Pod lifecycle events, such as a the last\nprocess in a container shutting down.\nIn Kubernetes v1.27, the <em>event based</em> mechanism has graduated to beta but remains\ndisabled by default. If you do explicitly switch to event-based lifecycle change detection,\nthe kubelet is able to start Pods more quickly than with the default approach that relies on polling.\nThe default mechanism, polling for lifecycle changes, adds a noticeable overhead; this affects\nthe kubelet's ability to handle different tasks in parallel, and leads to poor performance and\nreliability issues. For these reasons, we recommend that you switch your nodes to use\nevent-based pod lifecycle change detection.</p>\n<p>Further details can be found in the KEP <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3386\">https://kep.k8s.io/3386</a> and\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/switch-to-evented-pleg/\">Switching From Polling to CRI Event-based Updates to Container Status</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"raise-your-pod-resource-limit-if-needed\">Raise your pod resource limit if needed</h2>\n<p>During start-up, some pods may consume a considerable amount of CPU or memory. If the CPU limit is\nlow, this can significantly slow down the pod start-up process. To improve the memory management,\nKubernetes v1.22 introduced a feature gate called MemoryQoS to kubelet. This feature enables\nkubelet to set memory QoS at container, pod, and QoS levels for better protection and guaranteed\nquality of memory when running with cgroups v2. Although it has benefits, it is possible that\nenabling this feature gate may affect the start-up speed of the pod if the pod startup consumes\na large amount of memory.</p>\n<p>Kubelet configuration now includes <code>memoryThrottlingFactor</code>. This factor is multiplied by\nthe memory limit or node allocatable memory to set the cgroupv2 memory.high value for enforcing\nMemoryQoS. Decreasing this factor sets a lower high limit for container cgroups, increasing reclaim\npressure. Increasing this factor will put less reclaim pressure. The default value is 0.8 initially\nand will change to 0.9 in Kubernetes v1.27. This parameter adjustment can reduce the potential\nimpact of this feature on pod startup speed.</p>\n<p>Further details can be found in the KEP <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2570\">https://kep.k8s.io/2570</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-more\">What's more?</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.26, a new histogram metric <code>pod_start_sli_duration_seconds</code> was added for Pod\nstartup latency SLI/SLO details. Additionally, the kubelet log will now display more information\nabout pod start-related timestamps, as shown below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dec 30 15:33:13.375379 e2e-022435249c-674b9-minion-group-gdj4 kubelet[8362]: I1230 15:33:13.375359 8362 pod_startup_latency_tracker.go:102] &quot;Observed pod startup duration&quot; pod=&quot;kube-system/konnectivity-agent-gnc9k&quot; podStartSLOduration=-9.223372029479458e+09 pod.CreationTimestamp=&quot;2022-12-30 15:33:06 +0000 UTC&quot; firstStartedPulling=&quot;2022-12-30 15:33:09.258791695 +0000 UTC m=+13.029631711&quot; lastFinishedPulling=&quot;0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC&quot; observedRunningTime=&quot;2022-12-30 15:33:13.375009262 +0000 UTC m=+17.145849275&quot; watchObservedRunningTime=&quot;2022-12-30 15:33:13.375317944 +0000 UTC m=+17.146157970&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The SELinux Relabeling with Mount Options feature moved to Beta in v1.27. This feature speeds up\ncontainer startup by mounting volumes with the correct SELinux label instead of changing each file\non the volumes recursively.

Other\nfactorsthat may impact pod startup include container runtime, disk speed, CPU and memory\nresources on the node.</p>\n<p>SIG Node is responsible for ensuring fast Pod startup times, while addressing issues in large\nclusters falls under the purview of SIG Scalability as well.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-05-15 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/15/speed-up-pod-startup/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":3673,"Title":"ChatGPT and Elasticsearch: A plugin to use ChatGPT with your Elastic data","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-05-15 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/chatgpt-elasticsearch-plugin-elastic-data","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3663,"Title":"Batteries included: how AI will transform the who and how of programming","Description":"The recent arrival of LLMs capable of assisting programmers in writing, debugging and modifying code is yet another step.
